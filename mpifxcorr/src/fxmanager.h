/**
@class FxManager
@brief One object of this class manages the correlation

This class provides the functionality to control a correlation, by sending requests to Datastreams for data messages to be sent to 
specified Cores for correlation, and receiving the correlated visibilities from Cores.  After receiving the short-term accumulated
visibilities from Cores, it performs long-term accumulation in an array of Visibility objects and writes results to disk.
