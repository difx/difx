@class Core
@brief Accepts messages containing raw data, does the correlation, and sends off visibilities

This class provides the framework for doing the actual correlation, accepting baseband data from all telescopes, using Mode objects
to do the station-based processing and then performing the cross-multiplication and accumulation.  The accumulated visibilities
are then sent back to the FxManager.  An allocatable number of processing threads time-division multiplex the work.
