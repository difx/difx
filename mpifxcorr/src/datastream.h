@class DataStream 
@brief Loads data into memory from a disk or network connection, calculates geometric delays and sends data to Cores

This class manages a stream of data from a disk or memory, coarsely aligning it with the geocentre and sending segments of 
data to Core nodes for processing as directed by the FxManager.  Defaults are for LBA-style file and frame headers - the
appropriate methods are virtual so Datastream can be subclassed to give altered functionality for different data formats
