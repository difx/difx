@class Mark5BDataStream 
@brief Datastream which can handle Mk5B formatted data

This class manages a stream of data from a disk or memory, coarsely aligning it with the geocentre and sending segments of 
data to Core nodes for processing as directed by the FxManager.  Mark5BDatastream overrides the LBA-style defaults and
implements appropriate functionality for Mark5B formatted data.
