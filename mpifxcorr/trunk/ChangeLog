Version 2.0.0, 2010 July 14
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Many bugfixes to both band matching and multiple phase centres
* Visibilities now written out in binary format
* New polyco parser and checker is more forgiving of TEMPO2 generated polycos
* Can now produce kurtosis dumps every STA under the command of difxfilterbank
* Many nativemk5 inmprovements migrated from 1.5
* Many more minor bugfixes

Version 2.0, 2009 September 24
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Many, many changes both visibly and under the hood
* Allows support of multiple phase centres
* Writes each pulsar bin/source to a different DiFX file
* More efficient implementation of station-based processing, using
  complex multiplications to replace many sin/cos calculations (~20% speedup)
* More cache-efficient implementation of baseline-based processing
  for correlations with many channels where whole output array can't
  fit in cache simultaneously (factor of ~2 speedup for >=2k channels)
* Allows support of zoom bands
* Replaces blockspersend with subintNS, guardBlocks with guardNS
* Shifts numchannels/oversample/decimation etc from Configuration to Freq
* Allows use of Rule table in input file
* Adds support for LO offsets
* mostly complete Mark5B support
* Mark5B eVLBI support
* Visibilities with zero weight are not written to disk
* See http://cira.ivec.org/dokuwiki/doku.php/difx/documentation for more info
  on changes, particulaly for the file formats

Version 1.5 Perth, 2008 March 7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This version was born from the merge of the main trunk code and Walter's
native-mark5 branch.  In addition some new features were added:

1. Input file

  * HEADER O/RIDE is removed (never used) and replaced with
VIS BUFFER LENGTH, which was a compile-time constant.  Typical values for
this number are upwards of 8.

  * In the configuration table, two additional parameters have been added
after NUM CHANNELS:

  CHANNELS TO AVERAGE
  OVERSAMPLE FACTOR

Currently both of these only accept value 1.

  * In the datastream table, the format and data source parameters have
changed.  The four following parameters are now used:

  DATA FORMAT
  QUANTIZATION BITS
  DATA FRAME SIZE
  DATA SOURCE

2. Difx format output

  * WEIGHTS WRITTEN replaced with DATA WEIGHT.  The value is a float ranging
from 0.0 to possibly a bit more than 1.0, but no more than 2.0; the average
weight over many seconds of data should not exceed 1.0.

  * Exactly NUM CHANNELS of data are written out.  For upper sideband data
the first written channel is the DC channel and for lower sideband data
the last written channel is the DC channel.  The Nyquist channel is always
dropped.
