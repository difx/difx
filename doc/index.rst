A Guide to the DiFX Software Correlator
===============================================

Version 2.8

*Walter Brisken*

National Radio Astronomy Observatory

Introduction
-----------------

This manual is intended for many different audiences.
Typically a particular reader will only need to be concerned with a small portion of this guide, but there are a number of cross-references between sections.
This manual assumes some familiarity with Mark5 units, Linux, and the general way in which a VLBI correlator is used.
The following topics are discussed: running DiFX, coexistence issues with the VLBA hardware correlator, explanation of various file/document types, and detailed installation instructions.
This manual covers DiFX version 2.5 and periodically will be updated to current with DiFX improvements.
Please report any errors that are found in this manual to ``wbrisken@nrao.edu`` or to the DiFX developers mailing list ``difx-developers@nrao.edu``.
