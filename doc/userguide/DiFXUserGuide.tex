\section{Introduction}

This manual is intended for many different audiences.
Typically a particular reader will only need to be concerned with a small portion of this guide, but there are a number of cross-references between sections.
This manual assumes some familiarity with Mark5 units, Linux, and the general way in which a VLBI correlator is used.
The following topics are discussed: running DiFX, coexistence issues with the VLBA hardware correlator, explanation of various file/document types, and detailed installation instructions.
This manual covers DiFX version 2.9 and will be kept up to date with each official update to DiFX.
Please report any errors that are found in this manual to {\tt wbrisken@nrao.edu} .

To be consistent with this notation, all mention of programs by name or filenames (and portions thereof) are written in {\tt typewriter} font.
