This is a collection of container configuration files for Docker, Singularity, etc. The file names give some hint to the system they are designed for. Due to the MPI dependencies (versions must be ABI compatible between the host and container), it is unlikely that you will be able to use any of these directly, but they should serve as a useful template to get started, and need only minor tweaks for any other situation. For a software suite as complex as DiFX, figuring this out from scratch is moderately time consuming.
