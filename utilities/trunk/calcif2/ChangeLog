calcif2
~~~~~~~
Version 2.7.0
* Post DiFX-2.6
* difxvmf : Tool to calculate Vienna Mapping Function and apply to .im file (incomplete as of 20190318)
* If .v2d file has "+vmd" at end of delayModel parameter, then cause VMF to be used.  E.g., delayModel=difxcalc+vmf
  - if it has "+met" at end instead, calculate VMF using actual weather values; must be stored in files called <project>.<stn>.weather
* Pass options to the underlying calc program by prefixing with a +

Version 2.6.0
* Version for DiFX-2.6, Mar 4, 2019

Version 2.5.3
* looks for tirpc via pkgconfig to provide rpc/rpc.h

Version 2.5.0
* Post DiFX 2.4
* move difxsniff to SniffTools
* remove example that is no longer valid
* move some useful and quasi-useful scripts into more appropriate source trees
* respect new DELAY MODEL parameter of the .calc file: use to run non-standard delay model program
* remove non-functional Sekido model code
* Version for DiFX-2.5, May 16, 2017

Version 2.3.0
* vlog: split ANTAB file into antenna-specific files
* Version for DiFX-2.3, Dec 20, 2013
* Left unchanged for DiFX-2.4, Nov 4, 2014

Version 2.2.0
* Fix azimuth polynomial interpolation in case of wrap (John Morgan)
* Option to evaluate quality of delay interpolation (use -O 2 (or higher) and -v)
* Add polynomial fitting option (-F) .  This will take more CALC samplings than needed and fit
  a constrained polynomial (endpoints fixed) to that data.  This seems to produce marginally
  better values.  This new mode requires GSL.
* loose integration with an informal version of CALC with Sekido model
* Version for DiFX-2.2, June 1, 2013
