This is an unauthorized (but unlikely problematic) redistribution of the
streamstor SDK.  For an official distribution, please visit 
www.conduant.com or contact a Conduant representative for access to an
official version.  This package includes slight modification to the build
and installation processes with a slant on making a .rpm file easy.

To compile:

autoconf
./configure
make

And to install:

make install

But this is probably not what you came here for.  To build an .rpm file:

autoconf
./configure
make dist
rpm -rb streamstor-9.2a.tar.gz	# change version # as appropriate

The last step will either require root access or an environment conducive
to ordinary user, which can be accomodated by, for example:

echo "%_topdir /tmp/rpmbuild" > ~/.rpmmacros

Root permission will be required for installation.  Note that the .rpm that 
is produced will be, in general, compatible for only one kernel version.
RedHat Enterprise Linux tends to be conservative enough that minor
increments in kernels don't cause trouble, but this is not always true.

Note that this build process will fail, somehow, if it is not performed on 
a 32-bit Intel architecture Linux machine.  Also, there are Linux kernel
version requirements that change from version to version.  This particular
build on Nov 26, 2012 works fine on Redhat's kernel 2.6.18-274.12.1.el5.
