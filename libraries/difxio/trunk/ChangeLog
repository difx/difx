3.5.0
* Post DiFX 2.4
* Consider equality of EOP values when merging jobs
* Implement EOP merging modes.  Currently this will be set automatically based total number of days spanned by EOPs.
  - Relaxed means merge EOPs if they are consistent, with a resulting maximum of 6 days of values
  - Strict means only merge if EOPs cover the same days
  - In either case, refuse to merge if the EOPs are different on any day
* Replaced string with enums for three parameter names
  - Note: this breaks API compatibility.  Be sure to recompile all dependent code after updating difxio.

3.4.0
* Fix X/Y polarization issue
* Change internal representation of networkPort from integer to string to accomodate ethernet device names
* Fix polarization detection in cases where antennas have heterogeneous polarization needs
* Add psrflag utility -- looks at fringe rates beating against pulsar period with full pulsar gate as a window function 
* Psrflag utility updated to allow user-settable threshold
* Change reference frequency, used by difx2fits, to be the bottom edge of the first AIPS IF
* Version for DiFX-2.4, Nov 04, 2014

3.3.0
* Allow ".input" portion of input file to be optional
* Version for DiFX-2.3, Dec 20, 2013

3.2.0
* Now the DifxIF structures are _always_ set to be USB.  This will break compatibility with earlier versions of difx2fits and maybe difx2mark4.
* Add DIFX LABEL to .calc file
* Tcal requests will now return values outside sampled range, but will cause warning at end of processing.
* Support RX NAME parameter in FREQ table
* Experimental support for TLE spacecraft ephemerides
* Some segfault protecting in model writing (CJP+WFB)
* Experimental support for polarization dependent delay and phase offsets (CJP)
* Version for DiFX-2.2, May 31, 2013

3.1.0

* Version for DiFX-2.1, May 4, 2012

3.0.2
* Post DiFX-2.0.1
* Infrastructure for az, el, parallactic angle in model added
* Tcal managing structures and functions added
* Bug fix: simplifyDifxRules: allow number of rules to go to zero
* Version for DiFX-2.1, May 4, 2012

3.0.1
* Post DiFX-2.0.0
* All string parameters of difx_input have parameterized lengths
* Get rid of strcpy and strncpy in favor of more friendly snprintf
* Add optional VEX FILE parameter to .calc file
* Introduce new enum SamplingType 
* Add infrastructure for tcalFrequency
* Add DifxStringArray, which will be used for storing scan names and source names in DifxRule blocks
* Clean up, a little bit, the low level writing routines
* Considerable fixes to zoom band support
* Add Remap[] arrays inside DifxJob to account for pre-merged array indices
* Add some accessor functions to return a list of datastreams associated with an antenna.  This will be used to allow multiple datastreams per antenna.
* Add infrastructure to make redhat .rpm file
* Three fixes for ephemeris driven objects: EARTH -> EARTH BARYCENTER to match changed spice nomenclature, move to linear interpolation, and actually link to spacecraft table from source table
* Version for DiFX-2.0.1, Jun 10, 2011 / updated June 16

3.0
* Includes the following changes merged (hopefully correctly) from the DiFX-1.5 branch;
  - Merge fixes from trunk
  - Add network table infrastructure
  - Load > 1 pulsar polynomial from a file
  - Move flags to DifxJob so combinig multiple subarrays results in accurate
    application of flags.  NOTE: This breaks the API
  - Infrastructure for writing for file-based correlation
  - When sorting antennas, update the scan table (nAntenna, im and model)
  - Fix and simplify DifxInputGetScanIdByAntennaId
  - Fix for parsing of .flag file. 
  - Start some infrastructure for supporting proper flagging in cases of partially
    overlapping scans
  - Add difxcalculator under utils.  This is an implementation of
    http://cira.ivec.org/dokuwiki/lib/exe/fetch.php/difx/difx_calculator.xls
    as a stand-alone program
* Allows support of multiple phase centres in input/calc/im files
* Allows support of zoom bands
* Replaces blockspersend with subintNS
* Shifts numchannels/oversample/decimation etc from Configuration to Freq
* Allows use of Rule table in input file
* Adds support for LO offsets
* Fix memory leak (need to free baseline array)
* Print all spacecraft entries, not just for the first spacecraft
* Prevent merging of jobs that have incompatible clocks
* Change to polynomial-based clock model (up to 5th order)
* Move all data source information to DifxDatastream where it should be
* Respect and track all filenames rather than assume systematically named files
* rename all recChan variables to recBand for better uniformity
* remove baselineFreq2IF array which was complex and wrong and not needed
* RCFreqId was used with two meanings (that usually gave the same value).
  The true usage is now used everywhere. (Thanks to Randall Wayth for helping find this in DiFX 1.5!)
* Precision in source positions increased by two digits, now matches the 1.5 branch
* Rounding error fixed when mjdStart/Stop manually specified
* Track vex filename
* free rule array when deleting difxinput objects
* don't write out unused rules to input file
* bugfix preventing crash during job concatenation when number of antennas changes downwards
* Version for DiFX-2.0.0

2.11
* Post DiFX-1.5
* Implement profile mode (with mode=profile at the global level)
* Add writeDifxLineBoolean and use it for writing TRUE/FALSE values

2.10
* Deallocation option of function DifxBaselineAllocPolProds()
  - needed for more flexible frequency selection in vex2difx

  support in vex2difx.
