       * Attempts to clean RFI from a Covariance data set.
       *   
       * Uses two or more RFI reference antennas and subtracts
       * the weaker RFI seen by the array elements themselves from
       * the covariance matrix.
       *                                                                          
       * The reference antennas need to be present in the
       * covariance matrix. The full cross-correlation 
       * data between reference antennas and array elements must
       * be present in the covariance matrix.
       * 
       * For efficiency, cross-correlation matrix layout
       * needs to be such that RFI reference antennas come first.
       * Thus antennas with low indices (0, 1, 2, ...) must be
       * the RFI reference antennas. All remaining antennas must be
       * elements of the array.
       * 
       * If interferers are not overlapping in frequency,
       * there is at most one interferer per channel.
       * 
       * At cost of higher noise, more than one RFI per channel
       * can be handled, provided that Nrfi <= N_ref_antennas;
       * 
       * If Nrfi > N_ref_antennas, no subtraction is possible.
       * 
       * Correction bias: any correlated noise in the reference
       * antenna data adds bias to the correction. This can be
       * avoided by not spatially co-locating the reference antennas.
       * 
       * Toxicity: at low INR or no RFI presence, the correction reduces
       * to zero, the used algorithms are safe.
       *
