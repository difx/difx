Version 1.5
~~~~~~~~~~~
* Post DiFX-2.6
* Raise max number of threads to 256
* vdiffold & vdifd: don't pass nbit to vmux -- it is wrong.
* vmux: don't print errors to stdout, print to stderr instead, to keep stream clean
* functions called by vmux: don't print messages to stdout.
* vdifspec: allow passing of bchan and echan to m5spec
* python2 -> python3
* new utility: splitVDIFbygap : breaks a VDIF file into multiple based on time gaps
* filterVDIF: discard frames that had seconds less than previous frames
* introduce #define'd error codes for some common functions
* relocate mark5access:mark5bfile API into vdifio to be consistent with vdifio:vdiffile
* relocate mark5access:mark6gather_mark5b API into vdifio to be consistent with vdifio:mark6gather_vdif

Version 1.4
~~~~~~~~~~~
* New helper functions to read VDIF file while pre-arranging data to be more palatable for the memory based vdifmux()
  - vdifreaderOpen(), vdifreaderRead(), vdifreaderSeek()
* New utility: reorderVDIF based upon vdifreaderRead()
* Version for DiFX-2.6, Mar 4, 2019

Version 1.3
~~~~~~~~~~~
* Move all pure Mark6 functionality to mark6sg
* Python utils: explicitly call python2
* More conformant help and version information: printVDIFheader
* vdifmux(): change logic to determine first frame number if not explicitly provided -> simplified and probably faster and possibly more correct code.
* vdifmux(): make more robust in some parameter corner cases
* vdifmux(): nSort is now entirely referring to input frames; previously there was some use regarding output frames
* printVDIFheader: minor update for discerning two EDV Version 2 sub(sub)versions (EHT R2DBE, ALMA)

Version 1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~
* Post DiFX-2.5
* Some improvements in multiplexing very sparse data
* Options in vmux to change gap/sort tuning parameters
* Added ability to summarize a mark6 module in a specific slot
* new corner turners:
  - 1-bit with 32, 64 threads
  - 2-bit with 32, 64 threads
  - 4-bit with 32, 64 threads
  - 8-bit with 32, 64 threads
  - 16-bit with 32, 64 threads
  - 32-bit with 32, 64 threads
  - 64-bit with 32, 64 threads
  - 128-bit with 32, 64 threads
* Mark6Gatherer gets module serial number for mark6 activity message

Version 1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~
* Post DiFX-2.4
* Added incrementVDIFHeader
* Added ctypes-based Python bindings and one example (vdifio_1.py)
* vsum: error message -> stderr, not stdout
* Support new EDV2 that is produced by ALMA and R2DBE.  Work here is based on spec with TBDs: http://vlbi.org/vdif/docs/alma-vdif-edv.pdf
* New functionality in printVDIFheader:
  - Add Mark6 awareness:  If the Mark6 signature is found at the beginning, 28 bytes will be skipped to allow proper decoding.
  - If framesize is not provided at the command line, take from first frame
* New functionality in vmux
  - Support multiplexing multi-channel multi-thread data (each thread must have same general parameters)
* testmk6: test/example program for mark6 reading capabilities.  Does simple gather operation and file summary at this point.
* changes to multiplexing: increase max number of threads to mux to 64, warn if too many threads are being muxed, move out cornerturners to their own file.
  - note: ABI change.  Recompile of all code using vdifio is needed after updating to this version
* change a few key variables from "long long" to "int64_t" 
* cornerturners now all use sized integers for variables that care
* new corner turners:
  - 1-bit with 16 threads		(slow and convoluted; likely possible to do better)
  - 4-bit with 16 threads
  - 16-bit with 2, 4, 8, 16 threads
  - 32-bit with 2, 4, 8, 16 threads
  - 64-bit with 2, 4, 8, 16 threads
  - 128-bit with 2, 4, 8, 16 threads
  - Why need for large words?  It turns out that multiplexing multiple channels per thread is mathematically identical to multiplexing one channel per thread but with a total bit width of nBit*nChan
* VDIF multiplexer now supports multiplexing threads with more than one channel.
  - a change in the API for configurevdifmux() is likely coming that will simplify use of this.  For now, use setvdifmuxinputchannels() after configurevdifmux()
* New utility: filterVDIF.  It extracts certain threads and summarized what it found.  Similar to extractVDIFThreads.
* New utility: mk6gather: reads a VDIF stream from a Mark6 unit and writes it to a file.  Time reordering is done at the packet level.
* New utility: mk6ls: lists Mark6 "files" on system.  Respects ENV VAR MARK6_ROOT
* New utility: mk6vmux: directly multiplexes VDIF data from a Mark6 module
* vmux and mk6vmux (and in general any multiplexing) can be done on complex data
* Support for partial frame validity in multiplexed VDIF data (pending VDIF committee approval of EDV version 4 requested by WFB on 2015/10/09)
* Support for fanout in multiplexing (needed by some DBBC3 modes), both in library in vmux (very lightly tested)
* Some minor improvements to some utilities (improved help info, some parameter checking, ...)
* New function: void snprintvdiffilesummary(char *str, int maxLength, const struct vdif_file_summary *sum)
* Update help info for some utilties : fix "Usage" lines.
* vmux: all printf(...) -> fprintf(stderr, ...) so as to not interfere with stdout usage 
* vmux: stop on SIGPIPE: useful for piped operations
* vmux: don't segfault on incomplete command line
* Change name of .rpm file that is made to vlbi-vdifio.*.rpm
* vmux: some better default tuning parameters and move from signal() to sigaction()
* Version for DiFX-2.5, May 16, 2017

Version 1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~
* ******* NOTE CHANGES TO THE API *********
* Changed parameter in createVDIFHeader (pass size of dataarray not full VDIF frame).
* Changed function of getVDIFEpoch and setVDIFFrameSecond
* Renamed:
	getVDIFMJD
	getVDIFFrameFullSecond -> getVDIFFrameEpochSecOffset
	setVDIFFrameSecond -> setVDIFFrameEpochSecOffset
	setVDIFFrameFull
	setVDIFMJDSec -> setVDIFFrameMJDSec
	getVDIFDMJD -> getVDIFFrameDMJD
	setVDIFTime -> setVDIFFrameTime (and changed functionality)

* Added
	getVDIFFrameMJDSec
	setVDIFEpochTime
* Added new utility printVDIFgaps to examine a VDIF stream for missing data
* vdifmux now fed by a structure.  This allows for safer, faster and more flexible muxing.
* printVDIFheader: when legacy data don't print any EDV info
* multi2singlethreadVDIF: fixed bug where frames with invalid bit set had zero epoch and wrong seconds

* add function to decode data from a single frame of VDIF data

* Version for DiFX-2.3, Dec 20, 2013

Version 0.4
~~~~~~~~~~~
* Add new vdifmux function which takes a multi-threaded VDIF buffer, looks
  for frames with certain threadIds, and multiplexes them into a single-
  threaded output buffer.
* New programs exercising new library routines:
  - vsum       summarize contents of 1 or more VDIF files
  - vmux       multiplex a multi-thread VDIF file into a single-thread file
* New utilities (mirroring functionality of mark5access utilities):
  - vdifd      (m5d)
  - vdifbstate (m5bstate)
  - vdiffold   (m5fold)
  - vdifspec   (m5spec)
* Other new utilities
  - extractVDIFThreads: gets only packets corresponding to given thread IDs
* Inlinification and constification of many VDIF header access functions
* Large file clean (I think) now...
* Fix bugs in multi2singlethreadVDIF which caused crashes if many packets missing
