Version 1.7
* Post DiFX-2.8
* Add option to m5bstate to look only at even or odd samples
* m5pcal: can read from stdin
* Remove SVN headers in files
* Fix some spelling
* Add Python ctypes-based bindings for decoding complex data
  - ctypes has no complex data type, hence output is 2*N samples of ctypes.c_float
  - use numpy.frombuffer(<ctypes output>, dtype='complex64') to interpret output as complex data
* m5kb, m5subband and zerocorr: use fftw's memory allocation functions
* for 4 and 8 bit VDIF, make reconstructed sample values symmetric.  That is, the value corresponding to 2^(nbit-1) is no longer zero.


Version 1.6
* Post DiFX-2.6
* All examples: Added support for new, generalised CODIF and VDIF naming scheme
* Changed Mbps to a float, dealt with this by casting to int in legacy formats
* m5d, mark5streamunpacker: harmonise the way CODIF and VDIF files are treated
* format_codif, format_vdif: Fix calculation of frame granularity for CODIF (and VDIF,
  although that would never have been wrong). Fix decoder for complex 1-channel 2-bit.
  Cope with possible fill pattern data during format init.
* m5spec: allow specification of bchan and echan to limit range of channels being printed
* Remove broken/incomplete support for K5 format
* Remove support for non-format "VDIFB"
* m5fold: change all printf() to fprintf(stderr, ) so piping is clean
* m5fold: allow outfile to be - to imply stdout; this makes output quiet
* fix possible crash due to blanker operating on invalid data (thanks to Mars Buttfield-Addison)
* don't stop "example programs" when consecutive errors exceed a threshold.
* no longer print number of validation failures when closing a mark5_stream
* fix help information for the examples
* add 1, 2 and 4 channel decoders for 16 bit real VDIF
* add 5, 6, 7, 8, 16 channel decoders for 8 bit real VDIF
* add 16 channel decoder for 4 bit real VDIF
* add 3, 5, 6, 7 channel decoders for 2 bit complex VDIF
* add 3, 5, 6, 7, 16 channel decoders for 4 bit complex VDIF
* add 3, 5, 6, 7  channel decoders for 8 bit complex VDIF
* clean up and/or fix some of the (likely yet) unused decoders
  - some would not increase the input index when blanking
  - some increased the output index too much
  - 16 and 32 bit values had errors in converting to signed values
* add 24 channel decoder for 1 and 2 bits real VDIF
* add state counters for all 2-bit real VDIF modes with decoders
* Version for DiFX-2.8, Nov 4, 2022

Version 1.5.4

* Add ctypes-based Python bindings 
* Add Python examples (m5spec.py, m5stat.py, m5subband.py, m5time.py, m5tone.py, m5selfcorr.py)
* m5subband: extract a single subband by FFT-based filtering of a wideband input file
* m5pcal: now supports tones at non-integer MHz, better supports wideband recordings, 
  adds FFT length (--chunksize) option, and is updated to behave more DiFX-like
* m5d: adds complex decode (--double) and custom printout format (e.g., --format=%f)
* test5b: will now report skipped frames
* zerocorr: write results with %e to avoid scaling causing underflow results
* more const correctness
* functions added that mask bad values in channel-dependent manner from decoded VDIF streams if EDV4 is used.  Per-channel accounting of zero values is provided.
* Fix some data rate and frame rate calculations in mark5bfile.h
* New function: void snprintmark5bfilesummary(char *str, int maxLength, const struct mark5b_file_summary *sum)
* Change RPM name to vlbi-mark5access.*.rpm
* New option in test5b: can supply frames per second and then the true number of skipped frames can be evaluated.
* fixmark5b: don't seg fault if can't open files
* Many utilities: change from use of signal() to sigaction(), which is supposed to be more reliable.
