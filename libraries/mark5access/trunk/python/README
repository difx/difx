0 Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This Python module provides an interface to the C/C++ mark5_access
library and its VLBI data inspection and fast data decoding functions.

The main intention of this Python interface is to allow one to prototype
algorithms, and process raw VLBI data in numerical packages such as Numpy 
and Scipy that offer higher-level numerical computing.

Note that there are also other options to use mark5_access from Python.
These include SWIG or a hybrid language such as cython. The current interface 
ctypes-based due to the low complexity, and the one-way data path of mark5_access.


1 Preqrequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.1 Prerequisites for using the Python wrapper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mark5_access Python interface makes use of a standard Python
module called 'ctypes'. The ctypes project describes itself as 
"a foreign function library for Python. It provides C compatible 
data types, and allows calling functions in DLLs or shared libraries. 
It can be used to wrap these libraries in pure Python."
  https://docs.python.org/library/ctypes.html

You may install it with, for example,
  
  $ sudo aptitude install python-ctypes

In your Python script that calls mark5_access, use

  import ctypes
  import mark5access as m5lib


1.2 Prerequisites for re-generating the Python wrapper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the event that the C/C++ interface of mark5_access has
changed it is necessary to re-generate the Python wrapper code.

This wrapper is based on code generators that convert C header 
files into ctypes interfaces. These generators are part of the 
ctypes library utilities, specifically, h2xml.py and xml2py.py.

To install:

  $ sudo aptitude install python-ctypeslib

Note that ctypeslib version 0.5.6 has a buggy implementation 
of regexp handling related to command line option "-r <regexp>".
This option is used to extract C library function names.

In that version, a patch may need to be applied to 
the ctypeslib file 'codegenerator.py'. The patch is 
included here under ./patch/codegenerator.patch


2 Compiling and installing the mark5_access Python wrapper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, compile and install the mark5access library.

Next, make sure you patched ctypeslib file codegenerator.py
if necessary, see above.

Compile and install the mark5access Python wrapper by

  $ make                 # generates the ctypes interface
  $ make check           # checks if the generated file looks ok
  $ sudo make install    # installs the Python binding


3 Calling mark5access from Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Import the mark5access library Python interface via

  import ctypes
  import mark5access as m5lib

The mark5access functions have the same names and parameters 
as you would expect from the C/C++ library interface. 

Please refer to the "DeveloperGuide" and "UserGuide" documents
for details on the mark5_access library.

Usage in Python should be relatively straightforward.

You might, however, want to consult the examples in the ctypes
documentation at https://docs.python.org/library/ctypes.html,
or see an online "ctypes tutorial".

3.1 Some peculiarities worth pointing out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  1) mark5access library function arguments in Python will
     have 'ctypes' data types, such as ctypes.c_int.

  2) buffers passed between Python and the mark5access library
     are often declared as type ctypes.POINTER(<ctypes data type>)

  3) the contents of mark5access C data structures can be accessed
     via '<variablename>.contents.<name of structure field>'


3.2 Basic usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An existing file on disk can be opened as follows

 try:
     m5file = m5lib.new_mark5_stream_file(filename, ctypes.c_longlong(offset))
     m5fmt  = m5lib.new_mark5_format_generic_from_string(fileformat)
     ms     = m5lib.new_mark5_stream_absorb(m5file, m5fmt)
     dms    = ms.contents  # access to C structure fields like 'nchan', 'mjd' and others
 except:
     print ("Error: problem opening or decoding %s\n" % (fn));
     return EXIT_FAILURE

The array to be filled with new sample data can be allocated as follows

     FLT32ARR = ctypes.c_float*nsamples
     PFLT32ARR = ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_float)*dms.nchan
     pdata = PFLT32ARR()
     for i in range(dms.nchan):
         pdata[i] = FLT32ARR()

New data can then be read with

     m5lib.mark5_stream_decode(ms, nsamples, pdata)

To process decoded raw data of a particular channel in NumPy/SciPy/stats,

     chdata = pdata[channel_nr][0:nsamples]
     m = numpy.mean(chdata)

Alternatively, to access the same data but as a numpy array,

     chdata_p = ctypes.cast(pdata[channel_nr], ctypes.POINTER(FLT32ARR))
     chdata = numpy.frombuffer(chdata_p.contents, dtype='float32')

3.3 Example programs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A few example Python scripts can be found under ./examples/

   m5stat.py : A data statistics checker for raw VLBI data. 

               Has the same command line arguments as the C program 'm5bstate'.
               It performs a similar statistical analysis of the sample data 
               distribution (histogram) as m5bstate. In addition, it reports
               other moments such as standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis
               that especially for >2-bit data allow a better check of the signal
               Gaussianity in each recorded channel.

               Example output for a VDIF_8192-8192-4-2 format file with poor thresholds:

               Ch     mean    std    skew  kurt    gfact   state counts from -HiMag to +HiMag
                0    +0.01  +1.08   -0.40 +2.19    +2.62    1.5 / 46.3 / 52.1 /  0.1
                1    -0.11  +1.29   -0.53 +3.10    +1.96    5.7 / 44.4 / 48.9 /  1.0
                2    +0.02  +1.16   -0.26 +2.86    +2.29    2.2 / 45.7 / 51.0 /  1.2
                3    +0.03  +1.07   -0.23 +2.13    +2.65    1.0 / 46.9 / 51.7 /  0.4
               based on 81920 samples (0 invalid)

   m5time.py : Reports the first timestamp of a raw VLBI recording.

               In addition, it checks a few subsequent data frames in an attempt
               to verify the validity of the first timestamp and that the specified
               data format was indeed correct for the file. This check helps
               in particular with formats like VDIF that, unlike Mark5B,
               do not contain well identified magic bytes or "sync words"
               in their headers. 

   m5subband.py : Extracts a narrow subband using Fourier filtering methods.

               Performs DFT-based filtering. A specified channel in the raw
               VLBI recording is Fourier transformed and the desired bins of 
               the transform are copied and inverse Fourier transformed to 
               produce a time-domain narrow-band output signal.

               In order to improve the filter steepness and reduce sidelobes,
               the narrowband output signal is generated using windowed
               overlapped (I)DFTs, with zero padding, and phase coherent 
               overlap-add. Overlap factors of 2 (50%), 4 (75%), or more can
               be used. The bandwidth reduction ratio is quite freely selectable.

               For example, m5subband.py can output the time domain signal 
               from a 64 kHz wide band around, say, a maser line that is found
               in a 512 MHz wide recording.

               The narrow band output signal can be processed in other tools.
