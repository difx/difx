0 Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

mark5_access is designed to be extended to other stream types and formats
without recompilation of the core library.  I encourage useful additions
to be added to the library by sending a patch to wbrisken@nrao.edu.  
Certain functions, such as new_mark5_format_from_stream and 
mark5_stream_open currently only work on formats that are built into
the core library.  The easiest way to make your own stream or format
is to base it on the architecture of a simple existing stream or format.
If you are to make a new stream or format, please ensure that it is
both 32 and 64 bit clean and runs correctly on big- and little-endian 
machines.

1 The stream framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The (struct mark5_stream_generic) is defined by the following structure:

struct mark5_stream_generic
{
        int (*init_stream)(struct mark5_stream *ms);	/* required */
        int (*final_stream)(struct mark5_stream *ms);	/* required */
        int (*next)(struct mark5_stream *ms);		/* required */
        int (*seek)(struct mark5_stream *ms, int64_t framenum);
        void *inputdata;
};

It contains pointers to 4 functions that do stream-specific processing
and a pointer to a stream-specific (and private) data structure that
contains internal state information.  Only three functions are required.
Any unused optional pointer (data or function) should be null.


1.1 Making a new stream

To make a new stream type, only a single public function needs to be
written -- a constructor that returns a pointer to a newly allocated
(struct mark5_stream_generic).  This function should take as arguments
any parameters needed to characterize the stream.

The various functions pointed to by function pointers in (struct
mark5_stream_generic) must follow some strict rules to ensure proper
functionality.  All of these functions take as an argument a pointer
to the (struct mark5_stream) that is built from a generic stream and
a generic format.  The "input_data" pointer can point to private data 
and is for use only by the functions associated with the particular
stream.  If no such data is needed, the pointer should be set to null.

All functions should assume that the caller has already copied the 
pointer to inputdata.  See mark5_stream_memory.c for a simple example.


1.1.1 struct mark5_stream_generic *new_mark5_stream_XXX(...)

The constructor function may take any number of arguments of any type
and should be able to specify the characteristics of the stream to be
opened.  This function is required to do the following:

  * Allocate a (struct mark5_stream_generic) using malloc

  	M = (struct mark5_stream_memory *)malloc(
		sizeof(struct mark5_stream_memory));

  * Allocate private storage, or set inputdata to null.  Typically 
  	stream parameters will be copied into the private structure.

  * Set all function pointers to the stream functions to appropriate
  	values, or to null for optional functions that are not 
	used.

  * Return the pointer to the allocated (struct mark5_stream_generic)

A return value of 0 should be issued if the parameters don't specify a
legal mode of the format.


1.1.2 int (*init_stream)(struct mark5_stream *ms)

This required function must set appropriate initial values for the following
(struct mark5_stream) parameters:

    datawindow:	A pointer to the memory location where in-core
			data resides
    datawindowsize:	The length in bytes of the in-core memory

And optionally:

    streamname:		A string descibing the stream type

This is a good place to initialize state variables stored in the private
structure pointed to by "inputdata", such as information about the low
level aspects of the stream, includes freeing the private structure 
itself.  A negative return value shall indicate an error -- construction 
of a mark5_stream will cease at this point and call final_stream().  A
return value of 0 indicates success.


1.1.3 int (*final_stream)(struct mark5_stream *ms)

This required function is responsible for closing any open files or sockets
and freeing any memory that was allocated in the private data area.  This
includes freeing the private structure itself.  A return value of 0 indicates
success; return value less than 0 indcates a problem in reversing the
initialization.


1.1.4 int (*next)(struct mark5_stream *ms)

This required function simply reassigns the "frame" pointer to the memory
location of the next complete frame.  If required by the stream, this 
function is responsible for loading more data into RAM.  If the next
frame is not complete, the return value shall be -1.  Otherwise 0 shall be
returned.


1.1.5 int (*seek)(struct mark5_stream *ms, int64_t framenum)

This optional function sets the "frame" pointer to the beginning of frame
number "framenum", where framenum=0 is the first complete frame of the
stream.  In many cases, this will require (re)loading of data from 
a disc or similar depending on the nature of the stream.  Return value 
of -1 shall indicate that this is not possible; 0 should be returned on 
success.


2 The format framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The (struct mark5_format_generic) is defined as follows:

struct mark5_format_generic
{
        int (*init_format)(struct mark5_stream *ms);    /* required */
        int (*final_format)(struct mark5_stream *ms);   /* required */
        int (*decode)(struct mark5_stream *ms,          /* required */
                int nsamp, float **data);
        int (*gettime)(const struct mark5_stream *ms,   /* required */
                int *mjd, int *sec, int *ns);
        int (*fixmjd)(struct mark5_stream *ms, int refmjd);
        int (*validate)(const struct mark5_stream *ms); /* not yet used */
        void *formatdata;
	int Mbps, nchan, nbit;	/* The triplet */
};

The structure consists of four required functions, one optional function,
one possible function to add to future capabilities, and a pointer to 
a private data structure.


2.1 Making a new format

Making a new format is very similar to making a new stream (see sec 1.1
above).  All format functions should assume that the pointer to the private 
data has already been set and allocated by the format constructor function.
See mark5_format_mark5b.c for the simplest format.  Note that the choice
of the decode() function depends on the mode of the format.  This allows
for algorithm tuning on a mode by mode basis.


2.1.1 struct mark5_format_generic *new_mark5_format_YYY(...)

This is the constructor function for the new format.  It can take any
number of arguments.  It is up to the constructor to choose among the
various decoding algorithms based on the parameters passed to this 
function.  The selection is made simply by assigning the "decode" function
pointer to the appropriate function.


2.1.2 int (*init_format)(struct mark5_stream *ms)

The init function is responsible for doing any format initialization
that requires the associated stream to be already initialized.  For
example, it is usual to determine the offset to the first frame in the
stream in this function.  Several parameters of "ms" must be set:

    nchan:		the total number of channels represented by this format
    nbit:		the number of bits per sample
    samplegranularity:	all decodes and copies must be a multiple of this #
    framebytes:		the length in bytes of a data frame
    databytes:		the number of bytes in the frame representing data
    payloadoffset:	the number of bytes to skip at the beginning of a 
    				frame to get to data
    framesamples:       the number of samples from each channel in one frame
    format:		the format number type (enum Mark5Format)

and only if "datawindow" is a non-null pointer

    frameoffset:        the number of bytes to the first frame in the stream
    frame		the pointer to the beginning of the first frame
    payload		the pointer to the first data byte in the first frame
    mjd, sec, ns	the time of the first frame
    samprate		the number of samples per channel per second

and optionally (but suggested)

    formatname:		a text string containing the name of the format

The return value should be 0 on success and -1 on failure.


2.1.3 int (*final_format)(struct mark5_stream *ms)

This required function is responsible for freeing any memory that was 
allocated in the private data area.  This includes freeing the private 
structure itself.  A return value of 0 indicates success; return value 
less than 0 indcates a problem in reversing the initialization.


2.1.4 int (*decode)(struct mark5_stream *ms, int nsamp, float **data)

A decode function loops starts decoding at the read pointer 
(ms->payload + ms->read_position) and decodes data into output float
arrays pointed to by "data".  "data" should be a two dimensional matrix
with minimum size ms->nchan by nsamp.  Decode functions must detect end
of frames and request a call of the next function (with a call of
mark5_stream_next_frame(ms) ).  Note that this function may change
the location of ms->payload so this will need to be updated after each
call.  Note also that mark5_stream_next_frame() may return -1 indicating
end of data.  It is crutial that this function sets the value of
ms->read_position before exiting to point at the next unread value
before exiting, otherwise future calls to mark5_stream_decode() or
mark5_stream_copy() will return incorrect data.  On end of data, this
function should return a value of -1.  Otherwise 0 should be returned.


2.1.5 int (*gettime)(const struct mark5_stream *ms, 
	int *mjd, int *sec, int *ns)

This is a required function that returns the time associated with the first
sample of the current frame.  The returned time is in three parts: the
Modified Julian Day, integer number of seconds since midnight, and integer
number of nanoseconds since this second.  Null pointers for any combination
of these three must be supported.  The portions of time represented by
pointers with null value will not be returned.  A value of 0 should be
returned on success, and -1 on failure.


2.1.6 int (*fixmjd)(struct mark5_stream *ms, int refmjd)

An optional function to overcome potential ambiguities in date that is
common in VLBI formats.  Return values are as follows: -1 on error, 0
on success without change, >0 on success with a change in the mjd.


2.1.7 int (*validate)(const struct mark5_stream *ms)

The intention of this function is to provide a mechanism to verify that
the a valid frame begins at the ms->frame pointer.  This mechanism is
yet to be implemented.
