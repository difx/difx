// 
// Internal data types and structures for Mark6 scatter-gather
//
// There is apparently no documentation on the Mark6 non-RAID recording format(?).
// From Mark6 source code one can see that the several files associated with a
// single scan all look like this:
//
//  [file header]
//  [block a header] [block a data (~10MB)]
//  [block b header] [block b data (~10MB)]
//  [block c header] [block c data (~10MB)]
//  ...
//
// Block numbers are increasing. They will have gaps (e.g, a=0, b=16, c=35, ...).
// The 'missing' blocks (1,2,3..,15,17,18,..,34,...) of one file are found in one of
// the other files. Blocks can have different data sizes.
//
// Because 10GbE recording in Mark6 software is not done Round-Robin across files,
// the order of blocks between files is somewhat random.
//
// There is no provision for zero padding of the structures, this makes page alignment
// impossible, would have been nice for zero-copy mmap() <-- recvmmsg().
//
// The below structures are adopted from the source code of the
// Mark6 program 'd-plane' version 1.12:
