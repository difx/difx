Requirements:

1. You must have the Mark5 streamstor libraries installed

2. difxmessage is needed

To install from a fresh svn checkout, run the following:

aclocal
autoconf
autoheader
automake -a

./configure --prefix=$DIFX_PREFIX
make
# (su root?)
make install

After an svn update, these steps do not need to be rerun.  at most, running 
autoreconf should be enough, but usually just "make" will update 
everything properly.
