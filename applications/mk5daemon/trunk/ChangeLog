Version 2.5.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Post DiFX-2.4

* mk5cp: don't rewrite directory file unnecessarily
* Look for sigterm; tie to same exit routine as sigint
* A few cleanups
* mk5map now works better on mk5b data.  Still ugly.
* Support for SDK 9.4: SS_MODE_PCI (default mode) is no longer an option, so don't set it.
* Initial support for Mark6 units through the mark6meta library
* Initial support for command line structure
* mk5dir: can override (presumably incorrect) directory version number with --version1
* mk5dir: no seg fault if cannot open output file
* Adopt scripts listcpus and listmodules from calcif2 as this is a more natural home.
* mk5erase: new option to overwrite module partition.  Might be useful for firmware upgrades.
* Change .rpm filename to vlbi-mk5daemon.*.rpm
* mk5cp: report average data rate and total bytes copied.  Use replaced byte counter with lower false detection rate.
* Periodically (every 30 sec) look at OS swap usage and emit alert if in use
* mk5putdir: if binary dump file cannot be created, don't seg fault; instead tell user.

Version 2.4.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* mk5putdir: replace based on binary file / have ability to change version number

* mk5dir: save a copy of the binary directory as well as the decoded directory
* Revamped support for Mark5 directory structures: vsn, mk5dir
