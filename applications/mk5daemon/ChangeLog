* Post DiFX-2.6
* mk6dir: add extra column to output contaning size of scan in bytes
* python3ify: listcpus listmedia listmodules and killjob
  - note that Walter has converted mk5control, but not yet committed because

* mk5control: respond to new DIFX_MARK6 environment variable which lists 2-digit unit numbers that are mark6 units that would otherwise be assumed to be Mark5 units.
* mk5control: use machines file rather than env var DIFX_MARK6 if found and if python utilities are installed.

* Version for DiFX-2.6, Mar 4, 2019

* startfusemk5: new utility to start fuseMk5
