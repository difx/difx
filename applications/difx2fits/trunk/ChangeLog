  - rename "makefilts.tmp" to "makefits.tmp"
  - Apply flags properly, even in cases with crazy subarraying
  - Write file that summarizes jobs that went into FITS
  - Pass full command line option structure to UV writing
  - Normalize calling to all table writing functions
  - Properly populate GATEMODL table
  - Write .jobmatrix file
  - Write new WEIGHTYP keyword
  - Sniffer: keep one more amplitude digit
  - Sniffer: apd and apc files: keep 2 more time digits
* Adds support for multiple phase centres, zoom bands
* Also bugfixes for freeing memory
* Requires difxio 3.0
* Fixes by Olaf Wuchnitz: print format for writing strings to FITS and argument order in memcpy
* Some cppcheck results from Martin Ettl
* Don't fail to set proper .jobmatrix filename when not running sniffer
* Properly index config table in fitsGM.c
* makefits: pass --override-version on to difx2fits
