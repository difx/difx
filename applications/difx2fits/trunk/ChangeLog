Version 3.4.0
* Add command line option --primary-band.  This causes a keyword to be added to the output FITS file.  Intended for VLITE.
* makefits: check for files being multiple of 2880 bytes
* fixes in pulse cal handling: better logic in closing files, some improvements in code clarity and some minor performance improvements.
  - this fixes a bad bug when number of jobs is large; max number of file descriptors got exceeded.
* print MJD range of converted output

Version 3.3.0
* Improved clarity in generation of Flag, Tsys, Pcal, Gain and Weather tables: prioritized sources of data
* Fix off-by-one timestamp error in the sniffer output files
* All times are UTC (always have been).  Change variables and comments to reflect this and avoid some confusion.
* Add utility to show which sources of calibration data (GN, PH, FG, WX, TS) will be used by difx2fits (called showcal)
* Version for DiFX-2.3, Dec 20, 2013

Version 3.2.0
* Fix for correlation of mismatched sidebands.  Requires contemporaneous
upgrade of difxio.
* Add DIFX_LABEL env var to FITS files
* Make sniffer plots more consistent with AIPS.  They will always show USB now and should have the same phase sense.
* Use the SX gain table rows when SX observing is used.  Thanks to James Miller-Jones for reporting the problem.
* pcal, weather, tsys, and flag files could be compromized by observations spanning the new year.
  - Now handle day of year jumps
  - Also handle possible use of mjds rather than days of year in future
* increase number of phase cal tones allowed
* Version for DiFX-2.2, 31 May 2013

Version 3.1.0
* Version renumber from 3.0.2 prior to DiFX-2.1 release
* Version for DiFX-2.1, 4 May 2012

Version 3.0.2
* Post DiFX-2.0.1
* Improved reporting when weights go crazy (negative)
* --zero (or -0) option: don't write visibilities (well, write one per input file)
  - not useful for AIPS as AIPS requires a UV table
* makefits: pass along non-dashed options to difx2fits
* Do better job verifying baseband data files have compliant names.
* Improved checking on fopen return values
* Maximum number of file descriptors checked.  For large merges this can be a problem.
* Multiple DIFX files per job: don't write records from later files that overlap in time with those written by earlier ones.
  - perhaps later the order of things should change and the _newer_ records get kept.
  - multiple SWITCHEDPOWER and PCAL files are handled in the same way
* Make use of new difx_tcal infrastructure
* Support DiFX job restarts
* Better support for mixed 1 and 2 bit data: include antenna-based numbers in FITS and scale accordingly
* Populate the new RAOBS and DECOBS (pointing center) columns of the source table

Version 3.0.1
* Post 2.0.0
* Make use of clock shifting function in difxio
* Add in Difx-based pulse cal data
* Add in Difx-based tsys
* Fix TSys values in the zoom band cases
* Fix Pulse cal values in the zoom band cases
* DiFX extracted pulse cals: ensure proper antennaIds for merged job cases
* valgrind used to track down some memory leaks
* print fits keywords for each fits file when -v is supplied
* don't invoke sniffer in cases where it would use too much memory
* don't overwrite FITS when parse-all input difx are from different vex setups (thanks Jan Wagner)
* Version for DiFX-2.0.1, 10 June 2011

Version 3.0
* Includes the following merged changes from DiFX-1.5:
  - Copy jobmatrix file
  - rename "makefilts.tmp" to "makefits.tmp"
  - Apply flags properly, even in cases with crazy subarraying
  - Write file that summarizes jobs that went into FITS
  - Pass full command line option structure to UV writing
  - Normalize calling to all table writing functions
  - Properly populate GATEMODL table
  - Write .jobmatrix file
  - Write new WEIGHTYP keyword
  - Sniffer: keep one more amplitude digit
  - Sniffer: apd and apc files: keep 2 more time digits
* Adds support for multiple phase centres, zoom bands
* Also bugfixes for freeing memory
* Requires difxio 3.0
* Fixes by Olaf Wuchnitz: print format for writing strings to FITS and argument order in memcpy
* Some cppcheck results from Martin Ettl
* Don't fail to set proper .jobmatrix filename when not running sniffer
* Properly index config table in fitsGM.c
* makefits: pass --override-version on to difx2fits
* makefits: list all phase centres and pulsar bins, and use this info
* by default produce sniffer output only for bin=0 phasecentre=0
* conform to new variable names in difxio, and more importantly, don't go out of the way to get frequency labelling wrong!
* migrate to using EQUINOX in output FITS files
* Version for DiFX-2.0.0

Version 2.5
* Require difxio 2.10
* Post DiFX-1.5
* Sniffer: look for spectral lines

Version 2.4
* Post NRAO-DiFX 1.1 development
* Require difxio 2.5
* Fix numbering of FITS Source IDs
* Better handle transitional scans
* don't use bcopy -- use memcpy instead.
* fix sense of phase for LSB sniffer output data
* add makefits wrapper program
* Fix model tables when crossing midnight
* Version for DiFX-1.5

Version 2.3
* Support for writing FITS files larger than 2 GiB
* Option to force each input file into its own output file
* Pay attention to difx versions
* Don't write out vis records that occur over a scan change
* int -> double mjd for gain curve selection
* Respect DIFX_GROUP_ID and set umask
* Write sniffer file output
* Version for NRAO-DiFX 1.1

Version 2.1
* Sorts by antenna name by default.  override with -k

Version 2.0
* New visibility writing code -- will merge multiple input files
  into single FITS file in time order.
* use fitsSourceId to keep the source table as small as possible, without
  repeats
* fix delay values in ML (IM) table
* fix uninitialized freq offset vals in SU table
* use difxio >= 2.0
* start of pulsar table support

Version 1.9
