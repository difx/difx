Commit 9???  2021.02.28

* Forced sorting job files chronologically in fitsPH for processing
  phase calibration. Out of order jobs may result in loosing phase 
  calibration file.

* Changed the logic of handling pcal and cablecal files. The original
  logic stopped processing loop for a given antenna given job at 
  earliest the either pcal file or the cable cal file (if exists)
  reached the end. If cable calibration file was truncated, phase 
  calibration was lost beyond that epoch. The new logic continues 
  the loop for phase calibration processing after the end of cable 
  calibration file.

* Added support of environment variable DIFX_USE_CABLE_CAL. If set 
  to zero, cable calibration files are ignored.

Commit 9???  2020.09.18

* Support of a new options is added:
  -A --all-pcal-tones. When applied, all phase calibration tones within 
  recorded band are put in the output file overriding the tone selection
  defined in difx input files.

  Added statistics of printing skipped records.

  Added additinal debugging statements with verbose > 3.

Commit 9637  2020.07.30

* Support of three new options is added:
  -l --localdir *.calc, *.im, and *.difx are sought in the same directory 
  as *.input files. By default, difx assumes *.input files define full 
  paths of *.calc, *.im, and *.difx, and if it does not find, it issues an 
  error message and stops. This causes a problem if difx output is imported 
  to another system. 
  
  Now if *.calc, *.im, or *.difx file specified in the *.input file, are
  not found, difxio checks whether such a file exists in the same direction 
  as the *.input file. If it finds it and option --localdir is applied, 
  difxio takes it. If option --localdir is not used difxio writes a message 
  stating that the file was not found, but there exists such a file in the 
  same directory where the *.input is located, difxio suggests a user to 
  use option --localdir, if the latter file is that the user wants, and 
  stops with EXIT_FAILURE.
  
* Support of mixed mode polarization with --antpol option. Original FITS-IDI 
  specifications provide no room for mixed mode observations. Specifications
  have a finite hard-coded list of polarization combinations coded in
  STK_1 parameter that runs from -8 to 4. When FITS-IDI specifications
  were written, no mixed mode polarization observations were envisaged.
  
  A workaround is to support new value STK_1 -9 that refers to the polarization
  code of each station defined Antenna1Feed1 Antenna2Feed1 parameters that 
  were always exported to FITS-IDI. That scheme overcomes the limitation
  of the original fits-idi specifications. The order of polarization 
  combinations in a 2x2 visibility matrix: A1A1 A2A2 A1A2 A2A1. If some 
  polarizations were not recorded, for instance R or L, at one of the 
  antennas, the visibility is padded with zero. If the array had only
  circ or linpol antennas and all Stokes parameters were correlated,
  this scheme is equivalent to STK_1 -1 and STK_1 -5 respectively.
   
  By default, difx2fits refuses to process mixed mode polarization data.
  When --antpol option is used, difx2fits sets STK_1 to -9 and process
  the data.
  
  A sanity check allows only R, L, H, V, X, and Y polarization codes, 
  but the list of allowed codes can be easily extended in the future,
  if needed.

* There are datasets that misleadingly label HV data as XY. XY polarization
  according to the IAU convention has axes over right ascension and
  declination axes that are fixed on the sky, while HV polarization
  axes over the local horizontal and vertical direction are rotating
  on the sky. Data reduction of HV and XY of data is quite different.
  There are antennas with HV feeds and there are antennas with XY feeds.

  Option --polxy2hv re-labels polarization XY to HV. This option works
  only if --antpol is applied.

Version 3.7.0
* Post DiFX-2.6
* python3 conversion: showcal, plotpcal, plotpcal2, gentcal, makefits

Version 3.6.0
* SU table: make more IDI-FITS compliant
* AG table: fill in antenna diameters, or 0 if not known.
  - values used in difxio: difxio/antenna_db.c
* AG table: override mount type with antenna_db.c values
* Header: look in all .difx/ directories that are contributing to FITS file and dump contents of *.history into HISTORY section of FITS file.  This will not duplicate two .history files with the same name in the same FITS file.  .history files should be text files.  Any lines in these files longer than 70 characters will wrap.  These .history files get included after any history files included at command line.
* Generate data for new kind of sniffer plot: examination of cross-pol response
* Print info why FITS files were split
* New command line option:  --max-jobs: specify maximum number of jobs to combine into a single FITS file.

* plotpcal2 : second attempt to plot pcals in a more general way.  Still not super satisfactory.
* Fix a case where absence of pulse cal file leads to seg fault (NRAO bug VLB-134, second part)
* Fix a long-standing (introduced in 2009 for DiFX-2.0) problem in generating the MC table:  The last term in the clock polynomial (ususally the rate) was ignored, causing incorrect entries in both the clock (due to drift since the reference time) and clock rate columns of this table.
* Support multiple datastreams per antenna.  Only changes really needed were in handling of DiFX-extracted pulse cal.
* Lynn Matthews reported a problem with AN tables when performing VBGLU.  Problem was found to be populating POLCALA and POLCALB arrays witn NOPCAL=0, causing confusion in AIPS.  Fixed.
* Fix jobmatrix output when subneting and/or given difx files not in time order
* Adding support for taking union of frequency setups; depends on incomplete implementation in difxio
* Don't raise a warning for a normal case where the sniffer buffer can be breached by one element.  Just ignore it and move on.
* Support frequency setup merging using the --union option
* Support building FITS files for profile mode correlations
  (autocorrelations included for bins > 0)

* makefits: check for files being multiple of 2880 bytes

  - this fixes a bad bug when number of jobs is large; max number of file descriptors got exceeded.

* add utility plotpcal
* update pulse cal: Use new, more natural format for .difx/PCAL* files made by mpifxcorr
* allow addition of history though external file (--history option)

Version 3.3.0
* Improved clarity in generation of Flag, Tsys, Pcal, Gain and Weather tables: prioritized sources of data
* Fix off-by-one timestamp error in the sniffer output files
* All times are UTC (always have been).  Change variables and comments to reflect this and avoid some confusion.
* Add utility to show which sources of calibration data (GN, PH, FG, WX, TS) will be used by difx2fits (called showcal)
* Version for DiFX-2.3, Dec 20, 2013

Version 3.2.0
* Fix for correlation of mismatched sidebands.  Requires contemporaneous
upgrade of difxio.
* Add DIFX_LABEL env var to FITS files

Version 3.0.2
* Post DiFX-2.0.1
* Improved reporting when weights go crazy (negative)
* --zero (or -0) option: don't write visibilities (well, write one per input file)

* makefits: pass along non-dashed options to difx2fits
* Do better job verifying baseband data files have compliant names.
* Improved checking on fopen return values
* Maximum number of file descriptors checked.  For large merges this can be a problem.
* Multiple DIFX files per job: don't write records from later files that overlap in time with those written by earlier ones.
  - perhaps later the order of things should change and the _newer_ records get kept.
  - multiple SWITCHEDPOWER and PCAL files are handled in the same way
* Make use of new difx_tcal infrastructure
