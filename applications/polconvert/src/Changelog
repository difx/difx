- Parallactic angle can now be corrected in converted antennas.
- Adapted the pulse-cal code for multi-file correlations.
- Cleaned up the code.
- Fixed problem in ChiSq code when the scans weren't in time order.
- Added sample EU-VGOS scripts.

- fixed some buggy parallactic angle code relevant to single dish

v1.8.0
- first cut at portage to Python 3

v1.7.8

- fixes for calibration table flexibility (getcol replaced by getcell)

v1.7.6

- New options to estimate cross-gains from station metadata (pcals).
- New configuration keywords to fine-tune non-ALMA cases (VGOS).
- Synchronized with DiFX 2.5.3 PP scripting for 2018
- Updated build to respect numpy includes

v1.7.5

- set zero weight on unphased APP subscans (phases not updated)
- continued non-ALMA development

v1.7.4

- Added some protections for problematic antennas in ALMA data tables
- Support for polarized calibrators (for non-ALMA observations).

v1.7.3

- minor bug fixes

v1.5 - v1.7

- antab for ALMA is now correct; missing cross-pol autocors for ALMA now fixed

- partial support for non-ALMA linear pol sites (EVN, &c.)
- autocrosscorrs now fixed (for GMVA)

v1.4

- Bandpass mode for the cross-polarization gains.
- Parallactic-angle computation (to enable the use of RR and LL in the X-Y gain estimate).
- Global Cross-Polarization Fringe Fitting, to find X-Y gains.
- New C++ module to solve for gains.

v1.3
