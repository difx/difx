COMMAND NAME:   fourfit

SYNOPSIS:  Performs fringe searching for continuum MkIV data

SYNTAX:  fourfit [-a] [-b BB:F] [-c controlfile] [-d display device] [-e]
            [-f value] [-m value] [-n value] [-p] [-r afile] [-s naps]
            [-tux] [-P polar_pair] [-T trefoffs] [-X] data file list 
            [set <control file syntax statements>]
         Where all arguments except the data file list are optional.
         The [-r afile] option replaces the data file list, however.
         The "set" argument and the commands which follow it must
         come last.  All option flags must appear before the data file
         list.  Option flags can come in any order.

    Here are examples of command-line invocations of fourfit, with
    an explanation of what they do:

fourfit -pt -c control 101-0620/3C279.051V4B
        Test mode, steps through all baselines polarizations for
        this scan.  Without the -pt, the fringes would just be
        written in individual files in 101-0620, with one file
        per baseline-pol-frequencygroup type.

fourfit -txas -m 1 -c control 018-234505 set mb_win -0.0034 .004 freqs a b
        Test mode, xwindow display, accounting switched on, cross
        power spectrum plot switched on, moderately verbose, use
        control file named "control" in current working directory,
        process all data in scan directory 018-234505, override
        multiband delay search window and select channels 'a' and
        'b' only.

fourfit -r refr_list -c control -d hardcopy -b AT:S
        Process all data referenced by type 2 lines in the A-file
        named "refr_list", use control file "control", print the
        fringe plot on the default printer, process only baseline
        AT frequency subgroup S.

OPTION FLAGS:
        -a
            If specified, this option switches on accounting
            of CPU time and wall-clock time used in the various
            parts of fourfit.  When the program finishes, it
            produces a summary of these timing statistics.

        -b BB:F
            Allows the user to override the control file
            with a specification of the baseline and/or
            frequency group to be processed.  The syntax is
            flexible.  0, 1 or 2 characters before the colon
            refer to the baseline (one character is interpreted
            as a station), and 0 or 1 character after the colon
            is interpreted as the frequency subgroup.  You can
            use the control file wildcard character '?' in
            the baseline, but remember to protect it from the
            C-shell either by escaping it with a backslash '\'
            or enclosing the entire -b argument in single
            quotes.  If you wish only to specify the baseline,
            the colon may be omitted.  An error in the -b
            flag argument causes the flag to be ignored, and
            fourfit will continue execution.

        -c controlfile
            Specifies the file which contains parameters
            to control the operation of the program.  If
            absent, fourfit will use only the file pointed to
            by the environment variable DEF_CONTROL, which
            in turn defaults to $FF/cf_default as defined
            in the $HOPS/setup.csh file.  Any parameters
            set in a control file specified with the -c option
            override the default file values.  A description
            of the syntax of the control file, with an example,
            can be found later in this document.

        -d display_device
            Upon completion of a fringe fit, fourfit can
            optionally display the results using postscript.
            The valid choices for "display_device" are:
                diskfile:file.ps  save the plot in "file.ps"
                hardcopy          send the plot directly to lpr
                pshardcopy        print the plot via pplot_print
                xwindow           show the plot in an X11 window
                psscreen          the same, but allow GS_* options

        -e
            If specified, this option estimates the time required for
            processing by fringing the first scan and extrapolating to
            the remaining scans.  It is equivalent to -a -t with no
            display device, followed by some estimation.  Only the
            first data file mentioned will be included in the estimate.

        -f first channel
            overrides the default first channel (0) to facilitate
            plotting when there are more than 16 channels (see -n)

        -m value
            This flag controls the verbosity of the program via
            the integer argument "value", which typically ranges from 3
            (virtually silent except for major errors) to -3 
            (incredibly verbose, of use only to the authors of 
            the program).  The default is 2. An additional mode can
            be toggled on when m=4. This mode prints nothing except
            the name of the generated fringe file, which can be useful
            when calling fourfit from other scripts.

        -n number of channels
            When channels are overridden (see also the -f flag)
            this tells how many channels to put on the plot. Note
            that neither -f nor -n affect the actual fringe fit,
            just the plotting thereof.

        -p 
            This is equivalent to "-d psscreen".

        -r afile
            Puts fourfit into "refringe" mode.  Fourfit refringing
            is driven by an A-file input, which overrides any 
            correlator root files directly specified on the command
            line (i.e. the latter are ignored when the -r flag
            is specified).  The input A-file, of which there can
            be only one, may contain root, corel or fringe lines,
            but only the fringe lines are used to determine which
            data to process, by baseline and frequency subgroup.
            Obviously, the -r flag is inconsistent with the -u
            flag, and specifying both is an error.  Note that for
            afiles using HP-1000 (version 1) line formats, fourfit
            has to pre-check the disk for the existence of the 
            type 2 files.  The data area is controlled by the
            DATADIR environment variable.  It defaults to the
            value of $CORDATA.

        -s naps
            This parameter controls how many AP's are merged
            together into each plotting segment. Thus the number
            of time points shown in the phase, amplitude, and
            validity plots is so controlled. Additionally, the
            ph/seg and amp/seg statistics are calculated based
            upon the stated number of AP's in each segment.

        -t
            This flag places fourfit in test mode.  Everything
            works as normal, except that the output file is not
            written to disk, and the root file is not updated.
            This is useful when experimenting with different
            fringe-fitting strategies, in order to avoid cluttering
            up the disk.

        -u
            Normally, fourfit processes all data consistent with
            the data file list and the control information.  When
            this flag is specified, fourfit will also check the
            information in the type-2100 record of the root to 
            see if the data have already been processed by fourfit.
            If so, the data in question are skipped.  The "u"
            stands for update mode.

        -x
            This is equivalent to "-d xwindow".

        -P pp
            Controls polarization processing, where the 2 character
            string pp is one of four cross-polarization 
            states: LL, RR, LR, or RL.

        -T trefoffs
            If this option is invoked, the fourfit reference
            time will be calculated by taking the nominal scan
            start time from the ovex file and adding trefoffs
            (which is an integer # of seconds) to it.

        -X
            Forces fourfit to write cross-power spectra into
            type 230 records. This option is typically used for
            import into AIPS.

ARGUMENTS:  data file list
            This mandatory argument or arguments tells fourfit
            which data files to process.  The format of the data
            file specification is the standard one for all MkIV
            software.  You may specify individual filenames, 
            scan directories which contain data files, 
            experiment directories, or any combination of
            these three.  In the latter two cases,
            fourfit will descend the directory tree looking for
            data files to add to its internal list of files to
            process.  Only root files need be specified.  The
            data files actually fringe-searched are determined
            by the combination of the root files specified and the
            restrictions imposed by the control file or control
            parameter list (see below).  In the absence of 
            such restrictions, all data associated with the 
            specified root files are processed.

            Beware of trying to specify too many files or scan
            directories, as it is possible to overflow the Unix
            argument list buffer on large experiments.  In such
            cases, specify the experiment directory instead.

        The postscript rendering is performed by ghostscript
        [gs(1)], and GS_* environment variables can be used
        to produce a variety of graphics when the "psscreen"
        (see -d above).  For example,

        GS_OPTIONS=-sOutputFile=abc.png GS_DEVICE=png16 \
        fourfit ...

        will generate a 16-color PNG plot.

        set <control file syntax statements>
            This command line argument is optional, and
            is intended to permit rapid, temporary modification
            of 'fourfit' behaviour without the need to edit the
            control file.  The word "set" tells fourfit to expect
            additional control information on the rest of the
            command line.  The syntax of this control information
            is identical to that of the control file (see
            detailed description below).  The control file
            parser will detect syntax errors and abort if you
            do not follow the rules as laid down.  The control
            information you specify after the "set" argument
            on the command line applies to all data to be
            processed, and overrides whatever the control file
            itself specified for the parameters in question.

ENVIRONMENT:    DEF_CONTROL, DISPLAY, DATADIR, GS_DEVICE, GS_OPTIONS

DESCRIPTION:

Fourfit is the functional analogue of FRNGE on the HP-1000 systems, and
searches the data represented by the root and corel files for fringes,
writing the results of the search to files of type fringe.  The emphasis
in the design of the program has been speed and flexibility, particularly
with regard to future enhancements.  Algorithmically, the program is
closely modelled on FRNGE, with only minor enhancements as yet, based on
the availablity of greater computing resources.

Below is a preliminary form of a document describing in detail the format and
syntax of the control file:

KEYWORD SEMANTICS

**scan selection**

   skip          if this is set to true in the body of an if_block, then
                 any scans matching the if conditions will be skipped. 
                 Note: as of 99.2.19 fourfit will not properly skip data 
                 if f_group is specified.

**filtering**    determines whether or not each AP is accepted

   freqs         controls which frequency channels get included in the fit.
                 The letters a-p correspond to the order that the frequencies
                 appear in the root file (assuming 16 channels). With no
                 suffix, DSB is implied, if both sidebands are present.
                 A plus suffix denotes USB, a minus is used for LSB.
                 After 26 channels, the uppercase alphabet is used,
                 then 10 digits, finally '$' and '%' (i.e. 64 channels).
   start         start time for data to be included.
   stop          stop    "   "    "  "   "    "
                 Arguments of start and stop are integers with an optional
                 minus sign. A positive integer is interpreted as an
                 absolute time in seconds past the hour (of the scan
                 start time). When a minus sign precedes the start time
                 it is considered to be a time relative to, and later
                 than, the scheduled scan start. Similarly, a negative
                 stop time precedes the scheduled scan stop time, by
                 the indicated number of seconds.
   switched      turns on (frequency) switched mode, which discards some AP's
                 and keeps others, depending on a gating waveform
   period        period in seconds of the gating waveform
   gates         for each freq. channel, the starting delay and duration, in
                 seconds, of the gating waveform
   passband      lower and upper bounds (in MHz) of the spectral passband of
                 data to be accepted, specified as RF frequencies. If the
                 lower bound is greater than the upper bound, the range
                 wraps around -- allowing a band in the middle to be
                 excluded.  The data is rescaled so as to preserve the
                 amplitude observable (as if the data excluded were perfectly
                 valid); this means that the area under cross-power spectral
                 plot amplitude curve is approximately conserved.

                 to exclude from the spectral passband.  (Passband may be
                 applied prior to removal of these notches.)  Note that the
                 amplitude modification calculus isn't sufficiently
                 sophisticated to detect overlaps of passband and notches,
                 so be sure to keep your surgeries disjoint.  (A large number
                 is supported and you will get a complaint if you exceed it.)
                 As with passband, the spectral data is rescaled so that
                 the amplitude observable is in some sense preserved.
   dc_block      if set to true, zero out lowest cross-power spectral
                 channel; useful for suppressing DC bias
   min_weight    fraction of data which must be present for inclusion.
                 Normally, a weight between 0.0 and 1.0 is provided by
                 the correlator to represent the fraction of data actually
                 supporting the correlation value.  If you specify a minimum
                 weight, any AP not meeting this threshold will be discarded.

   *** deprecated filtering commands - for backward compatibility only: ***
   max_parity    maximum allowable fraction of bytes in error
   x_slip_sync   maximum # of frames w/ re-sync in reference station
   y_slip_sync      "    "  "    "   "     "     " remote      "
   x_crc         either keep or discard AP if reference time has CRC error

**search**       control the fringe-searching process

   sb_win        single band delay search window bounds, in us
   mb_win        multiband     "     "      "       "     "  "; if the upper
                 bound (2nd number) is less than the lower bound (1st
                 number), then fourfit performs a "wrap-around" search, in
                 order to handle the case of a delay near to the multiband
                 (semi-) ambiguity.
   dr_win        delay_rate search window bounds, in us/s 
   ion_npts      number of evaluation points in ionospheric coarse search
   ion_smooth    if true, use alternative search on smoothed TEC grid points
   ion_win       ionospheric coarse search window in TEC units
   ra_offset     apply right asc.offset (asec) to re-center search windows
   dec_offset      "   declination  "   (asec) "      "        "      "
   interpolator  selects method of fit interpolation. Classically, an
                 iterative search has been done over sbd, mbd, drate, one
                 dimension at a time, for 3 cycles. The simultaneous mode
                 constructs a 5x5x5 cube of data points and does a 3D
                 quintic interpolation.


**corrections**  apply corrections to the data, either before or after fit

   pc_mode   specify phase_cal mode:
              - normal (model linear in time is extracted from the data)
              - manual (specified totally by the user) 
              - ap_by_ap (phase cal is extracted independently for each AP)
                DEPRECATED: use normal or manual with pc_period 1 or more
              - multitone (all tones in band are coherently fit, and phase 
                is extrapolated to the center of the band).
   pc_phases phase_cal phases in deg, for each of the listed freq channels;
             these offset phases are added to the underlying model, as
             specified by pc_mode, above. If 2 polarizations are present,
             the same values are applied to both pols.
   pc_phases_l specified in same manner as pc_phases, but the tone phases
             so specified are applied only to the first pol (L, X, or H)
   pc_phases_r specified in same manner as pc_phases, but the tone phases
             so specified are applied only to the second pol (R, Y, or V)
   pc_phases_x synonym for pc_phases_l (see)
   pc_phases_y synonym for pc_phases_r (see)
   pc_freqs  phase cal tone frequencies in KHz, for each of the listed
             freq channels iff not in range -64..64. Inside of this
             range, the value is interpreted as a tone #, with 1 being
             the 1st USB tone, 2 being the 2nd USB tone, etc. Negative
             tone #'s are used for LSB tones.
   pc_period in multitone mode (only), the phase can be estimated
             and applied over each pc_period ap's, thus removing slopes
             or other drifts in pcal (default is 9999)
   pc_tonemask - in multitone mode (only):
             The values for pc_tonemask form a bit-masked map of which 
             tones to *exclude* for this frequency channel. Thus 1 
             excludes the lowest tone, 2 the next lower tone, 4 the 3rd 
             lowest tone, etc. A value of 5, for example, would exclude 
             the lowest and the 3rd lowest tones (perhaps 10 KHz and 2.01
             MHz).  
   pc_delay_l a time value in ns representing the difference between the
   pc_delay_r the travel time from the feed phase center to the pcal
             injection point, minus the the travel time from the pcal
             pulse generator to the injection point. It is specified
             separately for the two polarization senses.
   pc_delay_x
   pc_delay_y synonyms for pc_delay_l and pc_delay_r (see)
   pc_phase_offset_x
   pc_phase_offset_y a single additive phase given in degrees, which is
             applied to the pcal phase of every channel associated with a given
             polarization (also pc_phase_offset_l and pc_phase_offset_r)
   lsb_offset additive phase in degrees, for the LSB relative to the USB;
             often necessary when correlating VLBA data against Mk 3
   ref_freq  specifies a frequency in MHz at which the phase delay
             is determined (default is total LO of first frequency)
   adhoc_phase specify mode of ad hoc phase corrections. No corrections
             are made if this isn't present, or is set to false.
   adhoc_period  For ad hoc sinewave model; the period in integer seconds.
   adhoc_amp      "   "  "     "       "    amplitude in degrees of phase.
   adhoc_tref    For both ad hoc phase models; the reference time in seconds
             past the most recent hour.
   adhoc_poly For the ad hoc phase polynomial model; From 1-6 coefficients
             describing a power-series model in time. (deg/sec^n)
   adhoc_flag_file  Name of the file containing adhoc flagging.  Lines of this
             contain times (floating point days from beginning of year) and
             character strings to impose data flagging at a particular time
             (which remains in effect until the next time mentioned).  The
             character string has two characters per channel with a nonzero
             bit for data to be retained with the bit assignments as follows:
             (msb)USB-RL,LSB-RL,USB-LR,LSB-LR,USB-RR,LSB-RR,USB-LL,LSB-LL(lsb)
             If the string is too short, the last byte will be replicated to
             the remaining channels, so a single FF is adquate to retain all
             or a single 00 to discard all.
   adhoc_file Name of the file containing phases in the ad hoc file mode.
   adhoc_file_chans String of channel labels for phases (columns) in the
             ad hoc file.
   use_samples   If true, use the sampler statistics (aka state counts) to
             normalize the raw correlation sums to the equivalent analog
             correlation.
   ionosphere specified per station, in TEC (10^16/m^2) units
   t_cohere  coherence time used in fringe fit (default is infinite)
   delay_offs delay offsets (ns) to be applied to each of the listed freq
             channels. This correction is made prefit, similar to pcal.
   delay_offs_l same as above, but restricted to LCP.
   delay_offs_r same as above, but restricted to RCP.
   delay_offs_x same as above, but restricted to X linear pol.
   delay_offs_y same as above, but restricted to Y linear pol.
   samplers  the number of samplers, followed by the freq channel 
             identifiers of channels that share a common sampler are
             grouped together in strings. In multitone mode only, the
             averaged tone-derived differential delays are applied to 
             all channels sharing a sampler.
   optimize_closure modifies fine fringe search so as to minimize the
             contribution of non-closing delay errors to the closure phase;
             can result in poorer single-baseline fits
   station_delay a priori guess at the delay of the pcal path, from maser
             to the digitizers (ns). Recommended to use 
             sampler_delay_l/r/x/y instead.
   mbd_anchor controls the basis for choosing the mbd ambiguity when
             forming the total. If 'sbd' then the ambiguity closest to
             the singleband delay is chosen; if 'model' then the
             ambiguity closest to the a priori model is chosen.
   sampler_delay_l indexed by sampler, it is the center of the window
             in which the pcal delay ambiguity will be resolved. Just like
             the old station_delay, but now broken down by sampler and
             polarization, since their cabling and filters will lead
             to different delays. For LCP, in units of ns.
   sampler_delay_r same as the above, but for RCP, instead of LCP.
   sampler_delay_x synonym for sampler_delay_l.
   sampler_delay_y synonym for sampler_delay_r.

** miscellaneous functions
   chan_ids      changes the assignment of the channel labels
                 "abcdef..xyzABC..XYZ01..789$%" from the default values
                 to the ones specified by the corresponding list of floats
                 This is useful to prevent mis-matched IFs within one experiment
                 from causing the same channel label to be ambiguously used on
                 various baselines.  (You should ideally use exactly the same
                 frequencies as would be assigned by default.)
   plot_data_dir if present will be used as a path to dump the plot data
                 in a self-documented ascii form to allow export of plot
                 information to other arenas (specialized plots, &c).  One
                 file per fringe is written; more help is available within
                 the files that are produced: there is help for the options
                 that may be used to manipulate the content.
   fmatch_bw_pct associate freqs < this percentage of bw together (25% default)
   pc_amp_hcode  generate an H code iff any pcal amps less than this (0.005 default)
   weak_channel  the ratio of single_channel_amp to coherent_sum_amp 
                 below which a G code is assigned to the scan (0.5 default)
   gen_cf_record if true, saves the full control file in the fringe record
   est_pc_manual if nonzero, estimates manual pc_phase_? and delay_offs_?
                 values. A value >0/<0 estimates ref/rem station values.
                 The magnitude is a mask of bits indicating what and how
                 to make estimates.  0x01 phase, 0x02 median channel sbd,
                 0x04 average sbd channel, 0x08 use total sbd value,
                 0x10 use original per-channel sbd delay, 0x20 activates
                 heuristics to discard outliers and 0x40 reports phase
                 measurement as a pc_phase_offset_? value.  Finally, 0x80
                 can be used to supply a phase bias via an environment
                 variable (HOPS_EST_PC_BIAS).  Calculations are made with
                 channels in the -f and -n range (inclusive).  Conflicting
                 commanding on delay options results in no corrections.

SPECIAL FORMATS
   UT-epochs:  UT-epochs are expressed in the format ddd-hhmmss, where all 10
           characters are necessary, including leading 0's if
           appropriate.  This format will match that of a scan directory,
           if the UT-epoch that is being specified is an actual scan time.


GENERAL GUIDELINES

   1) White space is ignored; i.e., multiple spaces and line feeds all
      collapse to a single space.
   2) Multiple commands per line are fine.
   3) Comments: anything from an asterisk through the end of the line
      is ignored.
   4) Nested ifs are not allowed (or necessary). Nested parentheses in
      an if condition are fine (NYI).
      As of 94.1.16, parentheses are not supported. The logical operators,
      in decreasing order of precedence are (not, and, or).
   5) Wildcard "?" matches any single character for f_group, station, or
      baseline, any string (of up to 8 characters) for source, and any
      time-value for scan.
   6) Phase cal and delay offsets are treated station by station. If not
      in a "station context", then values are applied to remote stn only.
   7) Only freqs that are chosen for both stations in a baseline are 
      present in the fit.
   8) If multiple if-blocks match a particular passes' choice of baseline,
      f_group, source, and scan criteria, then the later values assigned
      to each parameter overwrite the earlier ones.
