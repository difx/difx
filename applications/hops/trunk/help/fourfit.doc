COMMAND NAME:   fourfit

SYNOPSIS:  Performs fringe searching for continuum MkIV data

SYNTAX:  fourfit [-a] [-b BB:F] [-c controlfile] [-d display device] [-f value]
	    [-m value] [-n value] [-p] [-r afile] [-s naps] [-tux]
	    [-P polar_pair] [-T trefoffs] [-X] data file list 
	    [set <control file syntax statements>]
		 Where all arguments except the data file list are optional.
		 The [-r afile] option replaces the data file list, however.
		 The "set" argument and the commands which follow it must
		 come last.  All option flags must appear before the data file
		 list.  Option flags can come in any order.

	Here are two examples of command-line invocations of fourfit, with
	an explanation of what they do:

fourfit -txas -m 1 -c control 018-234505 set mb_win -0.0034 .004 freqs a b
		Test mode, xwindow display, accounting switched on, cross
		power spectrum plot switched on, moderately verbose, use
		control file named "control" in current working directory,
		process all data in scan directory 018-234505, override
		multiband delay search window and select channels 'a' and
		'b' only.

fourfit -r refr_list -c control -d hardcopy -b AT:S
		Process all data referenced by type 2 lines in the A-file
		named "refr_list", use control file "control", print the
		fringe plot on the default printer, process only baseline
		AT frequency subgroup S.

OPTION FLAGS:
		-a
			If specified, this option switches on accounting
			of CPU time and wall-clock time used in the various
			parts of fourfit.  When the program finishes, it
			produces a summary of these timing statistics.

		-b BB:F
			Allows the user to override the control file
			with a specification of the baseline and/or
			frequency group to be processed.  The syntax is
			flexible.  0, 1 or 2 characters before the colon
			refer to the baseline (one character is interpreted
			as a station), and 0 or 1 character after the colon
			is interpreted as the frequency subgroup.  You can
			use the control file wildcard character '?' in
			the baseline, but remember to protect it from the
			C-shell either by escaping it with a backslash '\'
			or enclosing the entire -b argument in single
			quotes.  If you wish only to specify the baseline,
			the colon may be omitted.  An error in the -b
			flag argument causes the flag to be ignored, and
			fourfit will continue execution.

		-c controlfile
			Specifies the file which contains parameters
			to control the operation of the program.  If
			absent, fourfit will use only the file pointed to
			by the environment variable DEF_CONTROL, which
			in turn defaults to $FF/cf_default as defined
			in the $HOPS/setup.csh file.  Any parameters
			set in a control file specified with the -c option
			override the default file values.  A description
			of the syntax of the control file, with an example,
			can be found later in this document.

		-d display_device
			Upon completion of a fringe-fit, fourfit can
			optionally display the results in graphical form.
			At present, the only form of output is the
			traditional fringe plot (somewhat modified from
			the FRNGE version).  It can be presented in three
			ways:  In an X-window popup, in a disk file, and
			as hardcopy.  The corresponding values of the
			string 'display_device' are "xwindow", "diskfile",
			and "hardcopy".  For "xwindow", be sure to set
			your DISPLAY environment variable appropriately.
			The "diskfile" option is currently hardcoded to the
			filename "temp.fplot" in the current working
			directory.  The hardcopy option sends the plot to
			a printer under control of the script
			"/usr/local/bin/fplot_print".  At Haystack, this
			currently uses the printer named "east".

		-f first channel
			overrides the default first channel (0) to facilitate
			plotting when there are more than 16 channels (see -n)

		-m value
			This flag controls the verbosity of the program via
			the integer argument "value", which ranges from 3
			(virtually silent except for major errors) to -3 
			(incredibly verbose, of use only to the authors of 
			the program).  The default is 2.

		-n number of channels
			When channels are overridden (see also the -f flag)
			this tells how many channels to put on the plot. Note
			that neither -f nor -n affect the actual fringe fit,
			just the plotting thereof.

		-p 
			Causes a postscript plot to be displayed on an
			X-window.

		-r afile
			Puts fourfit into "refringe" mode.  Fourfit refringing
			is driven by an A-file input, which overrides any 
			correlator root files directly specified on the command
			line (i.e. the latter are ignored when the -r flag
			is specified).  The input A-file, of which there can
			be only one, may contain root, corel or fringe lines,
			but only the fringe lines are used to determine which
			data to process, by baseline and frequency subgroup.
			Obviously, the -r flag is inconsistent with the -u
			flag, and specifying both is an error.  Note that for
			afiles using HP-1000 (version 1) line formats, fourfit
			has to pre-check the disk for the existence of the 
			type 2 files.  The data area is controlled by the
			DATADIR environment variable.  It defaults to the
			value of $CORDATA.

		-s naps
			This parameter controls how many AP's are merged
			together into each plotting segment. Thus the number
			of time points shown in the phase, amplitude, and
			validity plots is so controlled. Additionally, the
			ph/seg and amp/seg statistics are calculated based
			upon the stated number of AP's in each segment.

		-t
			This flag places fourfit in test mode.  Everything
			works as normal, except that the output file is not
			written to disk, and the root file is not updated.
			This is useful when experimenting with different
			fringe-fitting strategies, in order to avoid cluttering
			up the disk.

		-u
			Normally, fourfit processes all data consistent with
			the data file list and the control information.  When
			this flag is specified, fourfit will also check the
			information in the type-2100 record of the root to 
			see if the data have already been processed by fourfit.
			If so, the data in question are skipped.  The "u"
			stands for update mode.

		-x
			Shorthand for -d xwindow.

		-P pp
			Controls polarization processing, where the 2 character
			string pp is one of four cross-polarization 
			states {RR, LL, RL, or LR}

		-T trefoffs
			If this option is invoked, the fourfit reference
			time will be calculated by taking the nominal scan
			start time from the ovex file and adding trefoffs
			(which is an integer # of seconds) to it.

		-X
			Forces fourfit to write cross-power spectra into
			type 230 records. This option is typically used for
			import into AIPS.

ARGUMENTS:	data file list
			This mandatory argument or arguments tells fourfit
			which data files to process.  The format of the data
			file specification is the standard one for all MkIV
			software.  You may specify individual filenames, 
			scan directories which contain data files, 
			experiment directories, or any combination of
			these three.  In the latter two cases,
			fourfit will descend the directory tree looking for
			data files to add to its internal list of files to
			process.  Only root files need be specified.  The
			data files actually fringe-searched are determined
			by the combination of the root files specified and the
			restrictions imposed by the control file or control
			parameter list (see below).  In the absence of 
			such restrictions, all data associated with the 
			specified root files are processed.

			Beware of trying to specify too many
                        files or scan directories, as it is possible to
                        overflow the Unix argument list buffer on large
                        experiments.  In such cases, specify the experiment
                        directory instead.

		set <control file syntax statements>
			This command line argument is optional, and
			is intended to permit rapid, temporary modification
			of 'fourfit' behaviour without the need to edit the
			control file.  The word "set" tells fourfit to expect
			additional control information on the rest of the
			command line.  The syntax of this control information
			is identical to that of the control file (see
			detailed description below).  The control file
			parser will detect syntax errors and abort if you
			do not follow the rules as laid down.  The control
			information you specify after the "set" argument
			on the command line applies to all data to be
			processed, and overrides whatever the control file
			itself specified for the parameters in question.

ENVIRONMENT:	DEF_CONTROL, DISPLAY, DATADIR

DESCRIPTION:

Fourfit is the functional analogue of FRNGE on the HP-1000 systems, and
searches the data represented by the root and corel files for fringes,
writing the results of the search to files of type fringe.  The emphasis
in the design of the program has been speed and flexibility, particularly
with regard to future enhancements.  Algorithmically, the program is
closely modelled on FRNGE, with only minor enhancements as yet, based on
the availablity of greater computing resources.

Below is a preliminary form of a document describing in detail the format and
syntax of the control file:

KEYWORD SEMANTICS

**scan selection**

   skip		 if this is set to true in the body of an if_block, then
		 any scans matching the if conditions will be skipped. Note:
		 as of 99.2.19 fourfit will not properly skip data if f_group
		is specified.

**filtering**    determines whether or not each AP is accepted

   max_parity    maximum allowable fraction of bytes in error
   x_slip_sync   maximum # of frames w/ re-sync in reference station
   y_slip_sync      "    "  "    "   "     "     " remote      "
   x_crc         either keep or discard AP if reference time has CRC error
   y_crc           "      "   "    "    "  "  remote      "   "   "    "
   freqs         controls which frequency channels get included in the fit.
		 The letters a-p correspond to the order that the frequencies
		 appear in the root file. With no suffix, DSB is implied, if
		 both sidebands are present. A plus suffix denotes USB, a
		 minus is used for LSB.
   index         alternate method used to select data channels, based on the
		 original corel index number. Not as well supported as freqs,
		 and is current being phased out.
   start         start time for data to be included.
   stop          stop    "   "    "  "   "    "

	 Arguments of start and stop are integers with an optional minus
	 sign. A positive integer is interpreted as an absolute time in
	 seconds past the hour (of the scan start time). When a minus sign
	 precedes the start time it is considered to be a time relative to,
	 and later than, the scheduled scan start. Similarly, a negative
	 stop time precedes the scheduled scan stop time, by the indicated
	 number of seconds.

   switched      turns on (frequency) switched mode, which discards some AP's
		 and keeps others, depending on a gating waveform
   period        period in seconds of the gating waveform
   gates         for each freq. channel, the starting delay and duration, in
		 seconds, of the gating waveform
   passband      lower and upper bounds (in MHz) of the spectral passband of
                 data to be accepted, specified as RF frequencies.

**search**       control the fringe-searching process

   sb_win        single band delay search window bounds, in us
   mb_win	 multiband     "     "	    "	    "	  "  "; if the upper
		 bound (2nd number) is less than the lower bound (1st
		 number), then fourfit performs a "wrap-around" search, in
		 order to handle the case of a delay near to the multiband
		 (semi-) ambiguity.
   dr_win	 delay_rate search window bounds, in us/s ra_offset
   apply right asc.offset (asec) to re-center search windows dec_offset
   "   declination  "	(asec) "      "        "      "

**corrections**  apply corrections to the data, either before or after fit

   pc_mode	 specify whether phase_cal mode is normal (model linear in
		 time is extracted from the data), manual (specified
		 totally by the user), ap_by_ap (phase cal is extracted
		 independently for each AP), or multitone (all tones in
		 band are coherently fit, and phase is extrapolated to the
		 center of the band).
   pc_period	 in multitone mode (only), the phase can be estimated
		 and applied over each pc_period ap's, thus removing slopes
		 or other drifts in pcal (default is 9999)
   pc_phases     phase_cal phases in deg, for each of the listed freq channels;
		 these offset phases are added to the underlying model, as
		 specified by pc_mode, above
   pc_freqs	 phase cal tone frequencies in KHz, for each of the listed
		 freq channels iff not in range -64..64. Inside of this
		 range, the value is interpreted as a tone #, with 1 being
		 the 1st USB tone, 2 being the 2nd USB tone, etc. Negative
		 tone #'s are used for LSB tones.
   pc_tonemask - in multitone mode (only):
		 The values for pc_tonemask form a bit-masked map of which 
		 tones to *exclude* for this frequency channel. Thus 1 
		 excludes the lowest tone, 2 the next lower tone, 4 the 3rd 
		 lowest tone, etc. A value of 5, for example, would exclude 
		 the lowest and the 3rd lowest tones (perhaps 10 KHz and 2.01
		 MHz).  
   lsb_offset    additive phase in degrees, for the LSB relative to the USB;
		 often necessary when correlating VLBA data against Mk 3
   ref_freq      specifies a frequency in MHz at which the phase delay
		 is determined (default is total LO of first frequency)
   adhoc_phase   specify mode of ad hoc phase corrections. No corrections
		 are made if this isn't present, or is set to false.
   adhoc_period  For ad hoc sinewave model; the period in integer seconds.
   adhoc_amp      "   "  "     "       "    amplitude in degrees of phase.
   adhoc_tref    For both ad hoc phase models; the reference time in seconds
		 past the most recent hour.
   adhoc_poly    For the ad hoc phase polynomial model; From 1-6 coefficients
		 describing a power-series model in time. (deg/sec^n)
   use_samples   If true, use the sampler statistics (aka state counts) to
		 normalize the raw correlation sums to the equivalent analog
		 correlation.
   ionosphere    specified per station, in TEC (10^16/m^2) units
   t_cohere      coherence time used in fringe fit (default is infinite)


SPECIAL KEYWORD VALUES
   ?         wild card character
   keep      32767
   discard       0
   true          1
   false         0
   


SPECIAL FORMATS
   UT-epochs:  UT-epochs are expressed in the format ddd-hhmmss, where all 10
	       characters are necessary, including leading 0's if
	       appropriate.  This format will match that of a scan directory,
	       if the UT-epoch that is being specified is an actual scan time.


GENERAL GUIDELINES

   1) White space is ignored; i.e., multiple spaces and line feeds all
      collapse to a single space.
   2) Multiple commands per line are fine.
   3) Comments: anything from an asterisk through the end of the line
      is ignored.
   4) Nested ifs are not allowed (or necessary). Nested parentheses in
      an if condition are fine (NYI).
      As of 94.1.16, parentheses are not supported. The logical operators,
      in decreasing order of precedence are (not, and, or).
   5) Wildcard "?" matches any single character for f_group, station, or
      baseline, any string (of up to 8 characters) for source, and any
      time-value for scan.
   6) Phase cal is normally treated station by station. 
   7) Only freqs that are chosen for both stations in a baseline are 
      present in the fit.
   8) If multiple if-blocks match a particular passes' choice of baseline,
      f_group, source, and scan criteria, then the later values assigned
      to each parameter overwrite the earlier ones.
