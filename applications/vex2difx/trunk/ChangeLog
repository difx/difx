Version 2.3.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Post DiFX-2.2

Version 2.2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* vexpeek: --bands mode
* Support writing of .machines file
* Improved support for FAKE
* Verify input files do not have DOS end of line characters
* Populate difxLabel in difxio->.calc and in .joblist
* Generate systematic threadId
* Verify all or none of the ephemeris parameters are provided
* c++11 compliance
* Don't allow subintNS greater than about 1 second (to ward off MODE errors)
* Remove "using namespace std" from .h files; goal is to remove them from .cpp files in time
* Track oversample value in channel structure; move checking downstream to
  more relevant code.
* Add a few features (ephemDeltaT, ephemStellarAber, ephemClockError) useful in
  exploring spacecraft ephemeris but probably not useful for operations
* change zoom band definition to always be USB (specify lower edge freq)
* Reorder Mark5B tracks to accomodate bitstream masks
* Consider two sources within 1 mas of each other to be the same
* Added separate mjdStart and mjdStop parameters for each antenna
* Version for DiFX-2.2, May 31, 2013

Version 2.1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Version number change prior to DiFX-2.1
* Allowed zoom bands to be used with profile mode also
* Version for DiFX-2.1, May 14, 2012

Version 2.0.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Post DiFX 2.0.1
* Bug fix: when sorting events, round to nearest 0.1 second
* Bug fix: order of operations in computing zoom channels: don't overflow integers
* Change parameters to be better optimized for larger bandwidths (at marginal, if any, impact to small bandwidths)
* Reimplement tweak integration time
* Fix zoom bands when statting with different bandwidths.  WFB gets a beer for this one!
* Start implementation of "global zoom bands" which can either be referenced from an ANTENNA or a SETUP
* Distinction between recorded and non-recorded channels is now more clear.  Only recorded channels will be correlated.
* No more VexFormat class.  Its contents were moved into VexSetup.
* vex2script: better job allocating RDBE personality and choosing whether or not to record
* set xmacLength and strideLength automatically for powers of 2 and powers of 5 FFT sizes
* Can set up "fake" correlations

Version 2.0.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* add -v option to vexpeek
* move most strcpy to snprintf and make use of parameterized string lengths in difxio
* add recordEnable map to VexScan.
* fix back-to-back scan handling when singleScan = False
* fix media changes that occur immediately before a scan change
* don't error-out if an ANTENNA block does not correspond to an entry in antennas list
* Follow refs to CLOCK entries; fall back on unreffed clocks only if no other clocks found first
* Follow refs to TAPELOG_OBS entries; fall back on unreffed VSNs only if no other VSNs found first
* Support proper vex epoch for SITE; allow mjd to continue to work
* Generalize vexDate just a bit to allow for the posibility of vexdate without all date fields
* Add sampling parameter to ANTENNA confuration
* When cross-pol enabled, allow correlation of R-L even if one antenna doesn't have both polarizations
* Try different subintNS until the readsize becomes reasonable (probably some tuning to be done still)
* Propagate .vex file phase cal extraction into .input file* Pass tcalFreq from .v2d to .input
* Support several different modes of pulse cal tone selection
* Allow different numbers of bits on different antennas within same Mode (Thanks Jasper Horrell for the bug report)
* Catch a few vex problems before segfaulting (thanks Chris Phillips for the bug report)
* Fix bug estimating the output size of the correlation
* Change the nChan input parameter to mean the number of post-averaged channels
  - Clarified in several places in the code whether nChan is nInputChan or nOutputChan
* FIXMEs are now #warnings
* Default pulse cal tone extraction mode is smart: that is take the two most extreme tones per band that are not within the outer 1/8 of the band if possible.
* Allow source names with underscores
* Fix bug calculating spectral averaging for zoom bands
* Ephemeris driven objects: use linear interpolation with a default interval of 15 seconds.  Results are much smoother.
* Version for DiFX 2.0.1.  Tagged June 12, 2011 / updated June 16

Version 2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~
* Jumped because in the mean-time difx-1.5 branch had gone to 1.1
* Includes the following corrections merged in from the 1.5 branch
  - Zero length scans are ignored
  - Warn if no clock values are applied on a job/antenna basis
  - oms2v2d: correct use of POLARIZATION
  - oms2v2d: respect TWEAK_INT_TIME parameter
  - oms2v2d: trap missing FFT_SIZE and SPECTRAL_AVERAGE parameters
* Also bugfixes related to variable initialisation
* Adds support for multiple phase centres
* Requires difxio 3.0
* Add support for VLBN "format" -- that is VLBA with no data modulation
* Use strict parsing by default
* Add deltaClock and deltaClockRate
* More user warnings
* Further fix to generated flags when an antenna is not in a job
* oms2v2d: trap missing FFT_SIZE and SPECTRAL_AVERAGE parameters
* Actually respect clock breaks!
* Fix some logic to avert some unneeded warnings
* Don't require DIFX_VERSION to be set
* Check that all supplied antenna, source, scan and mode names are in vex file
* Huge speed-up by not constantly sorting events
* Fix convergence problem when there is no time gap between modules
* Force v2d file to start with a letter
* oms2v2d: warn if both .skd and .vex are found; default to .vex
* Source names were confused: no distinction was made between the vex "def" name and the source name.  Fixed.
* Check for sources with illegal names
* Improved function/variable naming to indicate explicitly where some def names are used
* Vex loading error messages are slightly more useful
* Adapt to difxio changes where data source info was moved from antenna into datastream
* Support default ANTENNA setup in .v2d file
* Support new namings in difxio.  recChan -> recBand
* Fix year definition ( was correct in difx 1.5 for quite some time )
* Better default some difx2.0 specific parameters
* Don't write out rules which are not used in a given job
* improve checking of subintNS and averaging intervals
* prevent a crash when source RA and decs are changed
* add vexfile to .calc
* Version for DiFX-2.0.0

* Version for DiFX-1.5

Version 0.1
~~~~~~~~~~~
* simplified difx input file output
