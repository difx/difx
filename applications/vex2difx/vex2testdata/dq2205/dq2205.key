! HISTORY
!  VHC: VLBA Health Check (aka Network Monitoring)       (LOS 21/04/02)
!  minor mods by Greg Taylor 23/04/02, now aka auto-release test
!  assigned project code TR017A, runs 1 hour at 128 Mbps
!  Change of observing mode to 4IFsx8MHz, still dual pol: LOS 09/08/02
!  Change of observing mode to 8IFsx8MHz, now 1-bit only: LOS 15/01/03
!  Added different settings for barrel roll - go weekly!  LOS 30/01/03
!  Modified to include more filters (4, 16) and 2-bit     LOS 21/05/03
!  Corrected a typo in 9050 setup, and new PI information LOS 10/06/03
!  Changed scan order to have 2-bit not in between 1-bit  LOS 11/06/03
!  Analysts request longer scans and gaps; 1.5 h ok/Dave  LOS 24/06/03
!  Now MT326. Less readbacks for longer scans, esp 90/50  LOS 09/07/03
!  Shorten to make room for disk @ 512 Mbps testing       LOS 25/07/07
!  Included 512 Mbps testing by forcing FORMATs in SETINI LOS 08/08/07
!  Changed coravg to 2.000 for DiFX integration time      JO  09/23/09
!  Changed expcode to DQyxx to avoid reusing last decade's expcodes JO 01/05/10
!  Setups modified for DDC version; a few scans omitted.  JDR 02/25/13
!  Added a C to the expcode to indicate Mark5C version    JO 02/27/13
!  The above will only be when we run both A and C in the same week.
!  Fixed a setup error in band.6-8                        JO 03/26/13
!  Modified to use both RDBEs. Combined 21 and 18cm       RCW 02/03/14
!    Removed gaps.  No longer needed (I hope).
!    Use 250 kHz offsets for pcal.
!  Changed to a file that should run any time.            RCW 05/29/14
!  Eliminated old band.6cm & band.6-2 setups;             JDR 07/07/17
!    renamed wide band.6-64 as "standard" band.6cm        
!    64 MHz BW now standard test for ripples in IFs A/C.
!  Changed band_4cm to match band_6cm.                    JDR 07/07/17
!    64 MHz BW now standard test for ripples in IFs B/D.
!  Restored 6cm-4if scan at Analysts' request             JDR 09/01/17
!  Added dopincr=15.625 to force doppler on line pointing AS  04/10/19
!  Changed dopincr=250 per WB                             MS  04/17/19
!  Added 4 P band scans to look for RFI per E.M.          AS  11/02/20
