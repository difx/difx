C
C 1.1   OBSNT PROGRAM SPECIFICATION
C
C 1.1.1 OBSNT calls the database handler to fetch an observation. If the 
C       end-of-data is detected, a flag is set and CALC finishes processing the
C       experiment. Before each new observation is processed, OBSNT writes the
C       observation number, time tag, the baseline identification, and the 
C       source name. OBSNT is called once for each observation.

C                       system for a while) will get 'UTC TAG ' (2-digit
C                       year) as before.

C   OBSNT Program Structure
C
C   Try to move to the next observation.
      CALL MVREC ( 2, 1, 1, KERR(1) )
C
C   Check the error return to determine course of action.
C   KERR = 0 says observation found. KERR = 1 says end-of-file.
C   First check for database failure.
      IF ( KERR(1) .NE. 0 ) THEN
        IF ( KERR(1) .EQ. 1 )  GO TO 810
          CALL CKILL('OBSNT', int2(1), int2(KERR(1)))
      ENDIF
C
C   GET the time tag, the baseline id, and source name.
C    First try to get new time tag with 4-digit year. If not there, get old
C     time tag with 2-digit year. Doesn't really matter though. 
      CALL GETI ('UTC TAG4      ', ITAG,   5, 1, 1, NDO, KERR(2) )
       If (KERR(2) .ne. 0) 
     *  CALL GETI ('UTC TAG       ', ITAG,   5, 1, 1, NDO, KERR(2) )
      CALL GET4 ('SEC TAG       ', TAGSEC, 1, 1, 1, NDO, KERR(3) )
      CALL GETA ('BASELINE      ', LNBASE, 4, 2, 1, NDO, KERR(4) )
      CALL GETA ('STAR ID       ', LSTRNM, 4, 1, 1, NDO, KERR(5) )
C
C   Check for database errors and KILL if found.
      DO  N = 1,5
        NN = N
        IF (KERR(N).NE.0) CALL CKILL('OBSNT', int2(NN), int2(KERR(NN)))
      ENDDO
C
C   Kick the counter for another observation and set end-of-data flag to zero.
      KEND = 0
      KOUNT = KOUNT + 1
C
C   Write the observation line to the screen.
      IF (ILUOUT .NE. -1)
     .WRITE ( 6, 9000 )  KOUNT, ITAG, TAGSEC, LNBASE, LSTRNM
 9000 FORMAT (1X,I6,1X,I4,'/',I2,'/',I2,1X,I2,':',I2,F6.2,
     1 1X,4A2,'-',4A2, 1X, 4A2 )
      GO TO 820
C
C  End-of-file encountered, so set KEND and close the database.
  810 KEND = 1
      CALL FINIS(0)
C
  820 RETURN
      END
