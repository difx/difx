<div class="textblock"><p>Detailed description of the items contained in the Experiment Editor, and what they do.</p>
<p>The Experiment Editor allows you to create a new DiFX experiment (or "session"), optionally containing a pass and/or a list of jobs. It also allows an existing experiment to be edited and new passes and job sets to be created. All directory structures and files associated with the experiment are created on the DiFX host, as well as in the DiFX database (if it is being used), and the experiment, pass(es), and job(s) are listed on the Queue Browser on the GUI from where DiFX can be run.</p>
<p>As a user you control the specifics of a DiFX job using two files - the <code>".vex"</code> file, which describes your observations, and the <code>".v2d"</code> file, which (loosely) describes how you wish DiFX to process those observations (these definitions with apologies to the DiFX creators who defined these files and can certainly better - and perhaps differently - describe what they do). The Experiment Editor needs to be provided with a <code>.vex</code> file - one was presumably made available with your observations. Almost all of what the Experiment Editor does involves creating a detailed <code>.v2d</code> file. The <code>.v2d</code> file is then used by the <em>vex2difx</em> application to produce an <code>".input"</code> file or files - which in turn can be used to run DiFX. There are associated files and directory structures that are created as well, and some other details are seen to, but the point to take away is that until you hit the "Apply" button on the Experiment Editor you are using it to define a <code>.v2d</code> file and run <em>vex2difx</em> on it.</p>
<p>Alternatively, specified as an outline, the steps to creating a new DiFX experiment with the Experiment Editor involve: </p>
<ol>
<li>
Specify where your experiment will go and what it will be called. </li>
<li>
Get a <code>.vex</code> file. </li>
<li>
Detail all of the stuff that goes into the <code>.v2d</code> file. </li>
<li>
Hit "Apply" to generate the specified directory and dump the <code>.vex</code> and <code>.v2d</code> file in it, then run <em>vex2difx</em> to create DiFX jobs. </li>
</ol>
<p>The DiFX documentation provides a detailed explanation of <em>vex2difx</em> and the parameters that go into the <code>.v2d</code> file <a href="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/vlbi/dokuwiki/doku.php/difx/vex2difx">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Experiment Editor is launched either to create a new experiment (by picking "New" from the Queue Browser) in which case its title is "Create New Experiment", or to edit an existing experiment (by right-clicking on the experiment name in the Queue Browser and choosing "Edit Properties") in which case its title is "Edit
Experiment Properties". While the controls are identical, applying changes to an existing experiment has slightly different effects than those applied to a new experiment, as described below.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="general"></a>
Some General Information</h1>
<p>The Experiment Editor controls are organized in <a class="el" href="widgets.html#hierarchicalIndexedPanels">hierarchical indexed panels</a>, with a small number of "top level" panels that can be opened or closed based on whether you are interested in them or not. The "Identification Data" panel at the top of the Editor and the "Apply/Cancel" panel at the bottom are "permanent" - they cannot be closed.</p>
<p>Many of the settings in the Experiment Editor are "remembered" if you run it a subsequent time (and even between sessions of running the GUI). This is done to ease repetitive tasks, making the assumption that any time you run the Experiment Editor, a very good guess for the way you wish to run it is somewhat similar to the way you last ran it. For the most part this should save you time, however it bears watching here and there. If you change a setting that you never touch and don't even fully understand the consequences of just for fun, it may very well <em>stay</em> changed until you actively undo it.</p>
<p>Nothing happens to the DiFX host, the database, or your experiments until you hit the "Apply" button, so don't worry about playing with the controls (bearing in mind the caveat in the previous paragraph). You can always "Cancel" and start again if you get in a position you can't figure out how to back out of.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="idetificationData"></a>
Identification Data</h1>
<p>The experiment name, ID, directory, and some other items are used to uniquely identify an experiment and to access it in the database. Some of these items are not changed after the experiment is created, others can be but generally aren't, and some are meant to be changed. They are contained in the top section of Experiment Editor.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="experimentEditor_IdentificationData.png" alt="experimentEditor_IdentificationData.png"/>
</div>
<p><a class="anchor" id="experimentName"></a></p>
<h6>Experiment Name</h6>
<p>The experiment name is the name which appears in the Queue Browser. When an experiment is initially created, a default name will be generated - a combination of the word "Experiment" and the Database ID number. It can be changed to reflect something that better describes the experiment to the user. Due to restrictions imposed by the database, a 20 character limit is placed on the name length. Changes to the name are propagated to the "Directory" and ".vex File" parameters, unless those items have been previously changed (you have to hit return to make changes to the Experiment Name do this).</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="experimentNumber"></a></p>
<h6>Number</h6>
<p>The number is contained in the database, and I'm not sure what it is. I'll get back to you on this one. This is <em>not</em> the database ID.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="experimentStatus"></a></p>
<h6>Status</h6>
<p>The status describes the current state of the experiment. No doubt this will be used by the GUI in the future, but for the moment it is simply something the user can set for their own tracking purposes. If the database is being used the options permitted by the database are given for status. If no database is being used the status currently doesn't work and can't be changed, but ultimately a way of allowing the user to specify their own status strings will be implemented.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="experimentInDatabase"></a></p>
<h6>In Database</h6>
<p>This check box will determine whether the experiment is put in the database (for experiments that are already created, it will indicate whether they exist in the database). If the database is not being used, this item should remain unchecked. An experiment that was not, for whatever reason, originally created with this item checked can later be put in the database by checking it.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="experimentDatabaseID"></a></p>
<h6>Database ID</h6>
<p>This is the unique ID generated by the database to track the experiment. When an experiment is initially created, a "guess" for this number is generated (usually it is a pretty good guess). Later if the experiment is edited the number will accurately reflect the ID used by the database. If the database is not being used, the original guess is retained. This number cannot be changed by the user.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="experimentCreated"></a></p>
<h6>Created</h6>
<p>This field contains the creation time and date for the experiment. When a new experiment is created, the field will show the local time of the GUI host at the moment the Experiment Editor was opened. Once the experiment is put in the database, this time will change (hopefully not much) to reflect the actual creation time on the database host. This is not a user-settable item.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="experimentWorkingDirectory"></a></p>
<h6>Experiment Working Directory</h6>
<p>This is the "working directory" on the DiFX host under which all files and sub-directories associated with an experiment reside. It should be an absolute (not relative) path name - starting with a "/". When an experiment is created, this directory is created on the DiFX host (if necessary). If this parameter is later changed, it will cause the directory to be moved on the DiFX host. For either of these operations to occur, the DiFX user must have write permission to do them on the DiFX host. When the Experiment Editor is initially opened to create a new experiment, this field will be filled with a default Working Directory, to which the experiment name will be appended (unless you change the Experiment Working Directory by hand). The default Working Directory can be changed in the Settings menu <a class="el" href="settingsSection.html#workingDirectory">Working Directory</a> field.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="experimentVexFile"></a></p>
<h6>.vex File</h6>
<p>This is the name of the <code>.vex</code> file that will be stored (if creating a new experiment) or is already stored (if editing an experiment) under the Working Directory. A session of the Experiment Editor may work with only one <code>.vex</code> file at a time, however any number of <code>.vex</code> files may be associated with an experiment. The data stored in the <code>.vex</code> file is obtained using the "Get .vex File Content" as described in the next section.</p>
<p>If you already have a <code>.vex</code> file associated with an experiment and wish to create a new one, enter a new name in this field and obtain new content using "Get
.vex File Content". If you have several <code>.vex</code> files associated with an experiment and wish to use a previous one, the <b>Previous Files</b> button can be used to load it.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="getVexFile"></a>
Getting .vex File Content</h1>
<p>An experiment is associated with at least one <code>.vex</code> file - in most cases only one (although the GUI is designed such that more can be added - this is however an untested feature). The <code>.vex</code> file contains a complete description of an observing session, including times, frequencies, antennas used, sources observed, and scans collected (as well as other things). The GUI uses the <code>.vex</code> file to provide the user with the options that may be applied to tailor DiFX processing of the observations.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="experimentEditor_GetVexFile.png" alt="experimentEditor_GetVexFile.png"/>
</div>
<p>If you are creating a new experiment, you need a <code>.vex</code> file before you can go anywhere. Any set of observations should have an associated <code>.vex</code> file supplied with them (or provide some way of producing a file). The "Get .vex File Content" of the Experiment Editor provides you with a number of ways of obtaining <code>.vex</code> file data, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Grabbing a file from a location on the DiFX Host. </li>
<li>
Obtaining a file via HTTP. </li>
<li>
Obtaining a file via FTP. </li>
<li>
Using a file on the GUI Host. </li>
</ol>
<p>An option also exists to get a <code>.vex</code> file from another experiment, but this has not yet been implemented and may well disappear in the future.</p>
<p>The process for each of these options is similar - click the checkbox associated with the method you like, fill in the field with a complete path or URL, and click "Go".</p>
<p>Note that when you pick a <code>.vex</code> file in this interface (when you hit "Go"), you are obtaining a copy of the <em>content</em> of the source you specify - the source file itself is <em>not</em> used for your experiment and will remain unchanged. The content is stored in the file location specified in the <code>.vex</code> file field in the Identification Data section (see <a class="el" href="experimentEditor.html#experimentVexFile">above</a>) when the Apply button is hit.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="vexFileEditor"></a>
.vex File Editor</h1>
<p>Once you have obtained .vex data from some source, the data are displayed in the ".vex File Editor" panel. This panel provides a (rather rudimentary) text editor that can be used to edit the .vex data by hand. The final edited text is used in the .vex file assigned to your created experiment, a copy of which is put in your working directory.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="experimentEditor_VexEditor.png" alt="experimentEditor_VexEditor.png"/>
</div>
<p>The content should be edited with some caution, bearing in mind that <em>no effort is made to check edits for sanity</em>. Any changes are propagated verbatim to the <code>.vex</code> file stored on the DiFX host, which is then used to produce <code>.input</code> files that are read by DiFX when it runs. Typographic or logic errors in the <code>.vex</code> content can produce any number of obscure and opaque errors. Don't mess around with the <code>.vex</code> file content unless you are confident you know what you are doing!</p>
<p>Changes are applied only when the <b>Parse Content</b> button is pushed. When the content are parsed, it is like loading an entirely new <code>.vex</code> file - subsequent menus will be altered to reflect it. So if you've put a lot of work into other settings within the Experiment Editor, be warned that they may be lost.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="correlationParameters"></a>
Correlation Tuning Parameters</h1>
<p>The Correlation Parameters section is something of a catch-all for items that don't fit neatly in any other sections. Most of these parameters end up in the "Setup" section of the <code>.v2d</code> file.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="experimentEditor_correlationParams.png" alt="experimentEditor_correlationParams.png"/>
</div>
<p>The Correlation Tuning Parameters section includes values that can be changed to adjust the quality of the correlation results, and/or the total time processing takes. Adjustments to many of these values is something of an art in itself, and the details of what things do and what their "best" values should be is not covered here (some talks at DiFX Users Meetings have covered the subject - slides can be viewed here).</p>
<p>Each item has an associated "apply" check box. If this box is not checked, no instructions regarding the item will be put in the <code>.v2d</code> file and <em>vex2difx</em> will be allowed to pick its own defaults. Unless you know what you are doing, don't check the apply box - let <em>vex2difx</em> pick the values! The GUI has default values for all items but they are not based on anything - they are essentially placeholders. The default values that are picked by <em>vex2difx</em> are far better.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="experimentStations"></a>
Stations</h1>
<p>The Stations section lists all of the antennas that were involved in the observations described by the <code>.vex</code> file.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="experimentEditor_stations.png" alt="experimentEditor_stations.png"/>
</div>
<p>Each station has an associated check box that can be used to remove it entirely from the observations (thus eliminating scans where the removal all baselines) - see here for more detail. Each line is also a title bar for a list of sub-sections that alter parameters related to their assoicated station. Click the title bar to open this list, and the title bar of each sub-section to open it. The following figure shows open sub-sections for the HT (Hartwell 15m) station:</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="experimentEditor_stationSubmenus.png" alt="experimentEditor_stationSubmenus.png"/>
</div>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="experimentStationsDataStream"></a>
Data Stream</h2>
<p>The Data Stream section is by far the most useful of the sections under each station, and the one part of the Experiment Editor you will almost always need to interact with. Data are required for the station to be used in correlations, and Data Stream tells DiFX where the data can be found.</p>
<p>Within the window you are provided four possible sources for the stations data:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="startli"><b>Module</b> data is stored on a Mark5 module. A field allows you to specify the module you wish to use by name. A pull-down menu provides all of the module names that are currently "mounted" and thus detected by <a class="el" href="index.html#runMk5daemon">mk5daemom</a>. <br/>
</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli"><b>Network</b> data is ultimately meant to allow a live network data stream to be used. Currently this capability does not exist at USNO, so the feature remains incomplete (as it is impossible to test). <br/>
</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli"><b>Fake</b> data tells DiFX to manufacture noise on the fly when the correlation is being run. There will be no coherent results, but the DiFX correlation will run. These data can be used to test some aspects of DiFX processing (such as how long it takes). <br/>
</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli"><b>Files</b> data is stored in files on an accesible file system. You must specify a file or group of files (using complete paths) using the <b>Filter</b> field. Files that match the path will be listed, along with check boxes so you can choose them individually. The Filter field provides tab completion. The specified paths should be as they would be seen on the node running <em>guiServer</em>, not (necessarily) where the GUI is being run.</p>
<p class="endli">You can also specify that the path you have chosen is a <b>File List</b> - a list of the data start and stop times associated with a list of data files. A File List can greatly speed up your correlation, particularly if you have many data files, because without it DiFX will plod through all listed files until it finds data with the correct time stamp. You can create a File List for all chosen data files using the <b>Generate FileList</b> button. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You must choose a source for your data stream.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="experimentStationsAntenna"></a>
Antenna</h2>
<p>This section is currently not used.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="experimentStationsSite"></a>
Site</h2>
<p>The Site section defines the physical location of the antenna, numbers that are initially obtained from the <code>.vex</code> file. Unless you know what you are doing you shouldn't mess with these numbers (the <b>Reset</b> button will return them to the <code>.vex</code> numbers if you change them accidentally).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="experimentStationsSettings"></a>
Settings</h2>
<p>The Settings section is a catch-all for other items related to stations. These should be self-explanatory. In general, default values are fine for these things.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="experimentScanStationTimeline"></a>
Scan/Station Timeline</h1>
<p>The Scan/Station Timeline provides a schematic of the entire experiment described in the specified <code>.vex</code> file. It shows all scans in the experiment, which antennas were used for each, and what the duration of each antenna's observations were.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="experimentEditor_scanStationTimeline.png" alt="experimentEditor_scanStationTimeline.png"/>
</div>
<p>The Timeline is a versatile tool, although for large experiments with many scans it can get a little crowded with information. Some of the things you can do: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Zoom in and out centered on a particular time</b> by pointing the mouse at a time and using the mousewheel. The time range displayed will be reduced by zooming in, centered on the time your mouse is pointed at. This can make details on the display much easier to read. </li>
<li>
<b>Pan through the timeline</b> by dragging the header with the time stamps. You can drag elsewhere on the diagram, but because mouse clicks do other things you may wish to avoid this. Dragging the timeline has a "momentum" feature to it, which is useful once you get accustomed to it. </li>
<li>
<b>Examine individual scans</b> by hovering over them. This will give you a pop-up window showing detailed information about the scan and the antennas used in its observations. </li>
<li>
<b>Remove/restore antennas from/to individual scans</b> by clicking on the bars representing the antenna observations. The bars will change from "filled" to "transparent" to reflect these changes. </li>
<li>
<b>Stop and start observations by individual antennas.</b> You can remove an antenna from the experiment by dragging a "stop" sign to a point on the timeline. The antenna will be removed from scans that occur after the stop sign. You can then restart the antenna by dragging a "go" sign on to the timeline - the antenna will then be included in subsequent scans. As many pairs of stop and go signs may be included as you like. You can't stop or start an antenna in the middle of a scan - an antenna's observations will either be part of a scan in total, or they will be removed completely. The GUI will handle this - you can drop the stops and starts within scans and they will be removed or added completely as appropriate. </li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="experimentSources"></a>
Sources</h1>
<p>The Sources window shows the observations described in the <code>.vex</code> file outlined by source name (as opposed to scan, which is the norm throughout the rest of the Experiment Editor.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="experimentEditor_source.png" alt="experimentEditor_source.png"/>
</div>
<p>All source included in the <code>.vex</code> file are listed using their names. Boxes show which sources have been observed with which stations. are show with the stations used to observe them. Sources can be selected and deselected, and stations can be selectively used or eliminated from sources.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Hover over the name of a source to produce a tooltip that includes information about the source as well as the names of the scans used to observe it and the stations used for each of those scans (stations marked in red have been eliminated). </li>
<li>
Hover over the boxes to produce a tooltip that includes which scans use the associated station on the associated source. A scan that appears in red text has been eliminated - either explicitly or because it lacks sufficient stations to form a baseline. </li>
<li>
Use check boxes to add or eliminate a source. When a source is removed, all scans associated with it are eliminated from the final experiment. When a source is added, all scans associated with it are put into the final experiment (assuming they have sufficient stations to form a baseline). These changes will be reflected in the <a class="el" href="experimentEditor.html#experimentScanSelection">Scan Selection</a> window. </li>
<li>
Click on the boxes to add or eliminate a station from the observations of a given source. Scans will be added or eliminated from the final experiment based on whether changes give them enough stations to form a baseline. </li>
</ul>
<p>The Sources section was developed originally with the idea that astronomical observers would be interested in sources (unlike in geodesy where their identities are uninteresting).</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="experimentScanSelection"></a>
Scan Selection</h1>
<p>The Scan Selection window allows you to select which scans within your experiment you wish to produce jobs for.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="experimentEditor_scanSelection.png" alt="experimentEditor_scanSelection.png"/>
</div>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="selectingScans"></a>
The Many Ways to Select Scans and Stations</h2>
<p>When new .vex data are selected, the GUI begins with the assumption that all observations described in the data will be included in the new experiment. There are a number of ways of adjusting which of the scans that make up the observations are ultimately used, and which stations are used in which scans, most of which are part of the <a class="el" href="experimentEditor.html">Experiment Editor</a>. Scan and station selection changes must be reflected in the <code>.v2d</code> and <code>.vex</code> files that are created as part of the new experiment, so selections are part of the experiment creation process. The <a class="el" href="experimentEditor.html#experimentScanSelection">Scan Selection</a> section of the Experiment Editor can be used at any time to view the scans that will be included in the experiment when it is created as well as which stations are used for each.</p>

<p>Some of the scan and station selection controls can work at cross-purposes - effectively they provide more than one way to cause a scan or a station to be used. When a conflict occurs, the GUI will give the most recent command precedence (if, for instance, a command is given that a scan be included in the final experiment when a previous command eliminated the scan, the GUI will include the scan).</p>
<h6>Eliminating Stations in the "Source" <code>.vex</code> Data</h6>
<p>Stations can be eliminated from individual scans by putting a "-1" in the "code" column within the appropriate "scan" section in the "source" <code>.vex</code> data. When the GUI encounters the "-1", it will remove the station from the scan. This duplicates hardware correlator behavior. Starting with the <code>.vex</code> file snippet below, the final <code>.vex</code> file will not include the station "Bd" because of the "-1" in the final column.</p>

<h6>Eliminating Stations in the "Stations" Section</h6>
<p>The Experiment Editor <a class="el" href="experimentEditor.html#experimentStations">Stations</a> section is primarily set up to change parameters related to each antenna involved in an experiment, and to select the data sources associated with them (see above). However it also includes a check box that can be used to completely remove each station from the experiment. Any scans that no longer have enough stations to form a baseline (i.e. less than two) will be eliminated.</p>

</div>
<h6>Changes With the "Scan/Station Timeline\"</h6>
<p>The Experiment Editor <a class="el" href="experimentEditor.html#experimentScanStationTimeline">Scan/Station Timeline</a> section provides a visual map of all scans and the stations used in them in a timeline. It allows the selection/deselection of individual stations within scans or the inclusion of data from different stations based on time. A detailed description of what can be done is <a class="el" href="experimentEditor.html#experimentScanStationTimeline">here</a>.</p>
<h6>Selecting by Source Using the "Sources" Editor<br/>
 </h6>
<p>The "Sources" section shows all sources and the stations used to observe them.&#160; It allows sources to be selected and deselected, and stations to be selectively used or eliminated from sources.<br/>
 <b>IMAGE<br/>
 </b></p>
<ul>
<li>
All sources included in the .vex file are listed.&#160; Boxes show which sources are observed with which stations. </li>
<li>
Hover over the name of a source to produce a tooltip that includes information about the source as well as the names of the scans used to observe it and the stations used for each of those scans (stations marked in red have been eliminated). </li>
<li>
Hover over the boxes to produce a tooltip that includes which scans use the associated station on the associated source.&#160; A scan that appears in red text has been eliminated - either explicitly or because it lacks sufficient stations to form a baseline.<br/>
  </li>
<li>
Use check boxes to add or eliminate a source.&#160; When a source is removed, all scans associated with it are eliminated from the final experiment.&#160; When a source is added, all scans associated with it are put into the final experiment (assuming they have sufficient stations to form a baseline). </li>
<li>
Click on the boxes to add or eliminate a station from the observations of a given source.&#160; Scans will be added or eliminated from the final experiment based on whether changes give them enough stations to form a baseline.<br/>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Sources section is something of a work in progress, and not something anyone uses at the USNO, so it is a little confused at this point as to what it wants to be.&#160; It was developed originally with the idea that astronomical observers would be interested in sources (in geodesy they are uninteresting).&#160; Suggestions are welcome.</p>
<h5>&#160;&#160;&#160; Selecting Specific Scans With the "Scan
  Selection" Editor<br/>
 </h5>
<p>At any time in the scan/station selection process, the "Scan
  Selection" editor will show which scans will be included in the final experiment (included scans are green, scans not included are gray).&#160; It allows the user to make selections on a scan-by-scan basis by clicking on individual scans, or by turning all scans on or off using the "Select All" and "Clear All" buttons.<br/>
 <b>IMAGE OF SCAN SELECTION PANEL WITH LABELS HERE<br/>
 </b>The Scan Selection Editor includes a "Time Limits" plot that shows all scans from the original .vex file as a time sequence (again, scans in green are included, those in gray are not included).&#160; The mouse wheel can be used to "zoom in" on different time limits, and the red and blue triangles can be grabbed and dragged to limit the final experiment in time.&#160; This widget is somewhat redundant with the Scan/Station Timeline Editor, but it may be useful to someone.<br/>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="experimentEOPData"></a>
EOP Data</h1>
<div class="image">
<img src="experimentEditor_eop.png" alt="experimentEditor_eop.png"/>
</div>
<p>Earth Orientation Parameter (EOP) data are necessary for a correlation process to run (they are required by <em>calcif2</em>). The Experiment Editor provides EOP data, when available, from two different sources:</p>
<ol>
<li>
The <code>.vex</code> file may contain EOP data. Often these data are a "projection" into the future, as they are produced when observations occur (and before actual EOP measurements are made). They are usually reasonably accurate. </li>
<li>
EOP data is obtained from a URL, as specified in the Settings window <a class="el" href="settingsSection.html#settingsEOPSettings">EOP Settings</a> section. If the URL is set up correctly, and the connection to the internet is good, these data should always be available. They will be at least as accurate as the "projected" data that may already exist in the <code>.vex</code> file, and in fact may represent actual measurements and thus be better (they most likely will never be worse). The GUI updates these data when it is started and roughly every hour thereafter. </li>
</ol>
<p>Data from either source can be selected using the check boxes next to the title bar for each source. Of the two sources, the updated EOP data are probably preferred (the Experiment Editor will pick them automatically when available), however there are imaginable circumstances where data from the <code>.vex</code> file may be preferred. For instance, it should be noted that because they are constantly updated the "Updated From Source" EOP measurements will <em>not</em> produce identical DiFX results for multiple runs on the same data. As stated before, changes will be small, and probably for the better, but they will not exactly match. If for some reason you need to eliminate changing EOP data as a source of changes in calculated results, use the <code>.vex</code> file EOP.</p>
<p>Your choice of EOP source (either <code>.vex</code> file or external URL) and the availability of EOP data will cause a number of things to happen when you eventually hit the <a class="el" href="experimentEditor.html#experimentApplyingChanges">Apply</a> button. The following is a list of actions taken by the GUI based on what it can do, and what it is told to do (note that the GUI will not allow you to choose a source for which data are unavailable):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>You choose the <code>.vex</code> file as the EOP source:</b> No EOP data will be installed in the <code>.v2d</code> file, and the <code>.vex</code> file will be copied to the DiFX host as is, with its EOP data intact. </li>
<li>
<b>EOP data are available <em>ONLY</em> from the <code>.vex</code> file:</b> Same as above. </li>
<li>
<b>You choose the external URL as the EOP source:</b> The EOP data in the <code>.vex</code> file is edited out before the file is copied to the DiFX host (this is the only instance where any changes are made to <code>.vex</code> files, but this action is necessary because combining EOP data from multiple sources is messy and dangerous). The EOP data from the external URL are put into the <code>.v2d</code> file. </li>
<li>
<b>EOP data are available <em>ONLY</em> from the external URL:</b> The <code>.vex</code> file is copied unchanged. The EOP data from the external URL are put into the <code>.v2d</code> file. </li>
<li>
<b>No EOP data available from either <code>.vex</code> or external URL:</b> Because a correlation won't run without EOP data, this is a "fail" condition. An error pop-up will be produced and no further "apply" actions will be taken. </li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="experimentNamesEtc"></a>
Names, Etc.</h1>
<div class="image">
<img src="experimentEditor_names.png" alt="experimentEditor_names.png"/>
</div>
<p>The Names section can be used to change the way <em>vex2difx</em> will name the input files it creates (an <code>.input</code> file is created for each "job"). By default, the <em>vex2difx</em> naming scheme is to use the "base" name of the vex file (e.g. <code>"foo"</code> for the file <code>"foo.vex"</code>) with an appended integer followed by <code>".input"</code>. For the first input file created the appended integer will be 1; the integer will increment for subsequent input files. For instance, if the <code>"foo.vex"</code> file is used to create three jobs, their input files will be called: </p>
<pre>
foo_1.input
foo_2.input
foo_3.input
</pre><p>If for some reason you don't like the default scheme, the Names section can give you some control over the names of the files that will be created. Two input fields allow you to specify the base name of each <code>.input</code> file (replacing the <code>"foo"</code> used in the above example) and the starting integer appended to the base name.</p>
<p>In practice, these settings are rarely used.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="experimentFineV2dFile"></a>
Final v2d File</h1>
<p>The <code>.v2d</code> file is the "configuration" file used by <em>vex2difx</em> to implement user adjustments when using the <code>.vex</code> file content to create one or more <code>.input</code> files. Most of the controls in the Experiment Editor are used to make changes to this file.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="experimentEditor_finalV2d.png" alt="experimentEditor_finalV2d.png"/>
</div>
<p>The Final .v2d File section shows the content the <code>.v2d</code> file that will be created in your working directory (when you hit <a class="el" href="experimentEditor.html#experimentApplyingChanges">Apply</a>). This content is continually updated as you make changes using other controls. If you feel confident you know what you are doing you can edit the content by hand - the text field is a primitive text editor - however any changes you make to other controls (any of those <em>above</em> the Final .v2d File section in the Experiment Editor GUI that is) will cause the <code>.v2d</code> content to be recreated and will erase your changes. If you need to change something by hand, do it last.</p>
<p>Any editing changes you make are immediate - there is no "save" button. The <a class="el" href="experimentEditor.html#experimentApplyingChanges">Apply</a> process copies the content of this editor, whatever it is, for the <code>.v2d</code> file that is created in your <a class="el" href="experimentEditor.html#experimentWorkingDirectory">experiment working directory</a>.</p>

<pre class="fragment">&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Creating a New Pass (or not!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Combine Scans in One Job&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The GUI can create jobs out of the specified scans in one of two
  ways, either as a series of individual scans with one job per
  scan, or a single job containing all scans.&amp;nbsp; Those who know &lt;span
    style="font-style: italic;"&gt;vex2difx&lt;/span&gt; well will recognize
  this as a slight change from what it does.&amp;nbsp; &lt;span
    style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Vex2difx&lt;/span&gt; can be set to create
  single-scan jobs, but otherwise it arranges scans in one or more
  jobs based on the "maxGap" parameter - breaking into new jobs only
  when the gap between two correlations exceeds this value.&amp;nbsp; In
  fact, the GUI essentially cheats by setting the "maxGap" parameter
  to something huge so scans are never broken into more than one
  job.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Status Bar&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is the GUI Doing?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you hit the "Apply" button, the GUI "creates" jobs on the
  DiFX Host that can then be run.&amp;nbsp; But what exactly is going
