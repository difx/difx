## Installation

### For DiFX Users

At the time of writing, the current stable version of DiFX is DiFX-2.8.1. You can look the DiFX tags for more version.

Then we recommend the user to check out stable version right now. If you want to check out v2.8.1, just type :

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/difx/difx -b v2.8.1
```

### For DiFX Developers

To install the latest dev branch of DiFX, follow these simple instructions:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/difx/difx
$ cd difx
# now there are just one main branch
$ git checkout dev
# Now you are in dev branch, 
# we will do the development based on dev branch
# until we want do a release tag version
# do coding now
```



### Compiling DiFX



```bash
# make sure the setting in setup.bash is correct (you will probably need to modify e.g. IPPROOT, MPICXX, etc)
$ source setup.bash # (or .csh). 
#You will probably want to add this to your .bashrc or .cshrc files

# Help on options for that last bit are available with ./install-difx --help.
$ ./install-difx --help

# It is highly recommended to build difx in an area other that the source tree (to avoid adding many untracked files)
$ cd /some/directory/in/which/to/build
$ /path/to/difx/repo/install-difx
```
